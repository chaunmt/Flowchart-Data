The course will emphasize a multidisciplinary understanding of obesity in the following areas:â€¢ Adipocyte biology, including relevant issues relating to fat storage, retrieval, and trafficking of intracellular energy; adipose tissue function at a system level especially factors favoring fat storage and retrieval.â€¢ Physiology of obesity, to include neural and hormonal influences on energy balance, including brain mechanisms of appetite, feedback mechanisms triggered by negative energy balance, hedonic mechanisms, and feedback systems triggered by excess consumption. The interaction between obesity and hypertension, inflammation, cardiovascular disease, sleep, exercise, stress and the microbiome. â€¢ Clinical consequences of obesity with specific reference to the many organ system dysfunctions related to excess body weight. Treatment of obesity, with understanding of behavior change therapies. Bariatric and pharmaceutical approaches to the treatment of obesity, with emphasis on basic mechanisms involving brain, adipose tissue, and adipocytes. We will also cover special issues related to fetal programming of diabetes and pediatric obesity. Study design and analyses for studies will be discussed within all arms. Students will engage in critical evaluation of literature in biological and clinical obesity prevention research. Course learning objectives:  The student will gain a comprehensive understanding of adipocyte biology and function; animal obesity models; physiology of body fat regulation; central nervous system regulation of energy intake and energy expenditure; cardiovascular disease, hypertension, stress, microbiome and sleep effects in obesity; genetic and individual propensity for obesity; fetal programming of diabetes and clinical consequences and treatment of obesity in adults and children; pharmaceutical approaches; an understanding of design and analyses in all types of studies, and an ability to critically analyze relevant literature. Prerequisites:  This 8000 level course is intended for graduate students pursuing graduate work in a health science-related program.  Undergraduate degrees can include, but are not limited to, a Bachelor of Science in nutrition, physiology, integrative biology or other related degree.  The instructor will consider other majors on an individual basis and permission.",
