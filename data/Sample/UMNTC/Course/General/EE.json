This involves understanding the parameters that are used to characterize antennas and how these effect system performance. An important aspect of the course is to provide the student with an understanding of the operating principles behind the most commonly used antennas. This is followed with exposure to basic design principles. These can be used to perform antenna design or can be used as starting points for design using an electromagnetic simulator. As part of the course, students will be exposed to simulator use through homework assignments and course project work. [EE 3601 or equivalent]",

This involves understanding the parameters that are used to characterize antennas and how these effect system performance. An important aspect of the course is to provide the student with an understanding of the operating principles behind the most commonly used antennas. This is followed with exposure to basic design principles. These can be used to perform antenna design or can be used as starting points for design using an electromagnetic simulator.

This class covers the basic physics of infrared emission and absorption in solid-state materials, molecules, and the atmosphere. It also discusses detector technology (with particular emphasis on types of semiconductor and quantum-dot photon detectors, microbolometers, and thermoelectric detectors) and the infrared spectroscopy of molecules to show why the infrared is so important in the study of chemical, biological, and atmospheric systems. The class will also examine types of commonly used spectrometers: cavity, dispersive, and FTIR and sampling of important applications: passive and active standoff detection, satellite climate and atmospheric monitoring, industrial and petrochemical analysis, and LIDAR.

Recent interest in learning methods is triggered by the widespread use of digital technology and availability of data. Unfortunately, developments in each field are seldom related to other fields. This course is concerned with estimation of predictive data-analytic models that are estimated using past data, but are used for prediction or decision making with new data. This course will first present general conceptual framework for learning predictive models from data, using Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) theoretical framework, and then discuss various methods developed in statistics, pattern recognition and machine learning. Course descriptions will emphasize methodological aspects of machine learning, rather than development of Â‘newÂ’ algorithms.prereq: CSE grad student or instr consent",

However, this status quo is being challenged by changing generation, consumptionand operational landscapes. Particularly, increased renewable generation, supply scarcity, the impetusto improve resiliency to extenuating weather impacts, and expanding electricity access call for thedevelopment of transformative architectural and operational paradigms. Recognizing these developments,this course will present enabling modeling, analysis, and control methods that will be integral toarchitect next-generation renewable-based power systems.
