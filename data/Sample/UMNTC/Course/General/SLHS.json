This course talks about the acoustics of speech as well as the main principles that are used to describe articulation and phonetics. We will examine the aerodynamic and acoustic principles that underlie sound production. The course also covers basics of auditory perception and how computers can be used to analyze and manipulate speech. Through an emphasis on physical analysis grounded in scientific principles, this course satisfies the university's physical sciences with laboratory liberal education requirement.",

This seminar compares music and language in all aspects of structure and use. We will highlight modern brain research studies on the associations and disassociations between music and language. We will also study how infants acquire their linguistic and emotional expressive power and how the early learning experience alters the brain, thereby affecting an individual’s future perceptions and actions.

This section will provide details on how hearing aids, cochlear implants, and other implantable hearing devices work and how clinical decisions are made with regards to who gets a hearing aid vs. a cochlear implant. Hearing assistive technology and wireless devices such as FM, loop and infrared systems will all be covered. The third T will cover treatment options for adults and children with hearing loss. This section will provide details on informational and personal-adjustment counseling, non-technology treatment options, and person-centered and family-centered intervention and training plans for adults as well as children with hearing loss.",
