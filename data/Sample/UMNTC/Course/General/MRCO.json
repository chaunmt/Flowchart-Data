It also explores changing identities and the complexity of Moroccan cultural politics. It is based on a balanced combination of the exploration of major academic scholarship from a comparativist and multi-disciplinary perspective, and insight into the lives and experiences of Moroccans, with particular focus on the inhabitants of Fez and the region.  Above all, it traces the blended trajectories and trends in Moroccan society and culture, stressing the pressuring challenges to Moroccan national identities posed by globalization, secularism, conservatism, and fundamentalism.

Semester and academic year students enrolled in the course for 3 credits will receive the same amount of individualized contact hours and put forth a total of 100 hours of research effort over the course of the semester.  In rare circumstances, a semester student may enroll in a 1-credit research project if they completed the summer program and are continuing into the semester.  They have the option to join the semester group for the Morocco in Context discussions and will be graded only on their research project.",
