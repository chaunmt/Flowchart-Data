These larger scale behaviors include pattern formation driven by cooperative sorting and advection dynamics.  They also include quasi-static and dynamic non-linear responses to stresses and other forcing.  Applications we discuss include particle transport in rivers, wetlands reclamation, pavement compaction, and industrial mixing.  As many large-scale and small-scale phenemonelogy can be counter-intuitive without experience, the in-class work is supplemented by two sets of hand-on activities. (1) students will explore these phenomenology in physical laboratories and (2) students will explore details unattainable in the physical laboratory by modifying existing computational simulations. (e.g., behavior in zero gravity, chaotic particle pathways, small-scale structures in colloidal suspensions).  Minimal prior programming experience is expected.  Programming assignments will be designed to be flexible for students of all levels of such experience.Prereqs: Graduate student in CSE or permission of instructor and/or CEGE 3502, MATH 2373, MATH 2374",
