Students will compare how Ghana and the USA have included students with special needs in the arts and the role integration has played in their literacy development. Thus, the class addresses arts play in special education through a comparative framework. In Ghana, music, dance, and drama are often expressed as integrated arts and offer an essential avenue for experiencing and thinking about other cultures. Children's arts play, such as singing games, chants, and jump rope games, occur in several spaces, e.g., playgrounds, marketplaces, and streets. You will participate in the local music traditions, interact with children with special needs in Ghana, and observe arts practice in special education in Ghana's primary teaching and community center. This course provides global education understanding opportunities through an immersion experience in an international context. This course involves a field exploration that will serve as a professional development opportunity while honing their research skills in a global context.",
