Products of frugal innovation, once proven locally, can be subsequently integrated into the broader R&D and product innovation processes within firms and become the base platforms for global products targeted at markets across the world.  Students will choose an industry or domain of focus in class sessions and be exposed to global R&D practices in large local firms and then interact with startups and innovators working on frugal innovation projects on the ground in India.
