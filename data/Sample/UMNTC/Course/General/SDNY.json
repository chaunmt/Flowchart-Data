The course will examine how the forces of colonization, migration, modernization, and globalization have affected the city and its inhabitants. Students will gain insights into the changing dynamics and identities of its inhabitants, and will also look at the forces, which have shaped Sydney’s relationship with the rest of the world. The course is organized thematically, with each theme examining different aspects of the city. It begins with an introduction to the city, then a discussion of Sydney as a colonial city, moving into an analysis of its identities, impact of migration and finally its commerce, cityscape and urban future. The course ultimately intends to help students contextualize their travels and encounters in the city, and will help them develop informed interpretations of Sydney while they are here.",

These influential films have been made and distributed outside of an American context but then repackaged for the West in remakes and variations that awaken an American audience to themes of horror that are decidedly non-European in substance.

Government responses—in the form of policies, restrictions, and approach to communication—varied widely across countries, as did the extent to which the virus spread among populations. Permanent changes to global health systems and structures continue to transpire, as do wider spread consequences of the pandemic to areas such as other health issues and diseases, gender and human rights, and international development agencies.In this course, students increase their awareness and appreciation for the deep and emerging ways in which individual countries and the global community has responded. They examine the impact of the virus and its management on communications, communities, and health and development systems. They make comparisons between the U.S., Australia, Italy, and China in order to directly relate learning to their local setting as well as contrasting responses internationally. Students also connect with experts drawn from Australia, Italy, and China, through CEA CAPA’s Globally Networked Learning technology.The course enables you to engage directly with Sydney as a specific landscape in which to explore and analyze responses to the COVID-19 pandemic and their effectiveness in Australia as compared to that of other countries, including a focus on the U.S., China, and Italy. You outline the complex interrelationship of individual, community, national, and international efforts to curb the pandemic, and understand the permanent changes to global health systems and structures that have already emerged and those that may still transpire.",

By exploring key issues and debates that are shaping contemporary Australia—and situating them historically—students gain nuanced awareness of the social, cultural, political, and economic currents surrounding them. In so doing, this curricular component supports and enhances students’ coursework and opens the possibility of more intentional exploration and engagement with Australia during their time abroad. In addition to classroom-based teaching and learning, Engaging Australia makes extensive use of experiential learning and field study as a means of engaging the content and the host location. Through a series of guest lectures, workshops, and excursions, students are introduced to key issues in identity, place, and belonging, and learn how to discuss how these are experienced and contested in Australia. Structured self-reflection is another important pedagogical tool that allows students to unpack and understand their academic and lived experience abroad.The course is embedded in the field of cultural studies and draws on insights from politics, history, environmental studies, anthropology, geography and sociology. Sydney is foregrounded and used as a means in which issues on local, regional, and national levels will be explored.  The core topics examine the forces shaping contemporary Australia and their historical context, and include:•Engaging (and unpacking) Sydney •The construction of the nation: collision and hybridity of past and present•Sustainability and the environment •Power relations: ethnicity, gender, class, and religion•Contemporary issues in the news•The Australian culture of education and lessons to be learned from studying abroad•Sport, music, and culture: the glue that binds us",
