The program does not lead to a state teaching certificate or licensure (note that a university certificate program or certificate is distinct from a state certificate or certification). \n\nIn Minnesota and other states in the US, dual language/immersion teachers at the elementary level are required to hold a teaching license in elementary education, and at the secondary level a license in the subject matter they teach (e.g., science, social studies, math). The University of Minnesota offers an initial teacher licensure program in elementary education with a focus on dual language and immersion education. \n\nThe dual language and immersion education certificate program is designed for preK-12 teachers and other professionals to be able to work effectively in the following school-based program models: \n- \"One-way\" foreign language immersion programs designed for native English-speaking students \n- \"Two-way\" bilingual immersion programs designed for native English-speaking students and native speakers of the program's partner language, such as Spanish \n- Developmental bilingual programs designed for minority language learners, such as native Spanish speakers \n- Indigenous language immersion programs designed for Native American children in indigenous communities with the goal of revitalizing an endangered language and culture \n\nIn dual language and immersion programs, the second/foreign/minority language that students are acquiring is a vehicle to teach school subjects. In order to be considered a dual language or immersion program, the immersion language must be used for at least 50 percent of subject-matter instruction during the elementary school years. In a middle/secondary continuation program, at least two, year-long content courses must be taught in the immersion language. \n\nThese programs aim for \"additive bilingualism and biliteracy,\" or the acquisition of another language at no expense to the first, native language. \n\nThis unique University certificate program incorporates a coherent set of courses designed specifically for dual language and immersion teachers, and other professionals. Offered by the college's Department of Curriculum and Instruction (C&I), the program was designed jointly by the college's Second Language Education faculty, and representatives of dual language and immersion programs in the Twin Cities metropolitan area.",

This certificate will offer advanced knowledge of the teaching of literacy through a focused, rigorous program while developing practicing educators' skills as teachers and writers in a supportive learning community.\n\nChanging literacy needs of students from all socioeconomic and educational backgrounds demand highly qualified teachers of reading and writing at the K-12 and postsecondary levels. Educators must prepare K-12 students to meet testing requirements at the state and national levels. In addition, teachers must meet the increasing literacy needs that accompany Minnesota's changing demographics of growing immigrant and English language learner (ELL) populations. Educators also must prepare students to communicate effectively by using new technologies.\n\nThe certificate program seeks to accomplish the following goals:\n\u0095 -Develop effective strategies for teaching the writing process to English-language learners and diverse populations, as well as reading and writing across the curriculum.\n\u0095 -Engage educators in current research about composition, reading, and learning theory.\n\u0095 -Create learning communities where educators reflect on their own teaching, reading, and writing.\n\u0095-Give educators opportunities to learn from other practicing educators.\n\nThis program begins with a three-week, 3-credit Minnesota Writing Project (MWP) Invitational Institute and then extends to allow educators to choose from a wider range of courses from multiple University departments throughout the academic year.
