Anthropology is partly a natural science, partly a social science, and partly a humanistic study. Anthropology minors learn to compare and contrast the biological, social, and cultural similarities and differences of humans and their societies across the globe and develop a sophisticated understanding of both the cultural diversity and the biological unity of our species.\n\nStudents who minor in the field are expected to take a minimum of one 1xxx-level course and four upper-level (3xxx or higher) courses that have a common focus. A common focus usually corresponds with one of the four sub-fields of anthropology: biological anthropology (the evolutionary history of human and nonhuman primates), archaeology (the study of prehistoric and historic societies through their material culture), sociocultural anthropology (the study of the behavior of recent people in settings that range from unindustrialized societies to modern urban centers), and linguistic anthropology (the comparative study of languages and communication). The Anthropology Department website (http://cla.umn.edu/anthropology/ba-anthropology) offers several examples of course sequences designed to provide training in particular sub-fields. A minor in anthropology provides many opportunities for graduates. It is seen as a useful degree within many businesses, for instance industry consulting, environmental consulting, product development, and marketing, as well as the nonprofit sector. Students with anthropology degrees are known to possess unique observational and critical thinking skills; and, perhaps more than with any other degree, they are aware of the role that culture plays in identity, relationships, and decision-making.\n\nAn anthropology minor is also excellent preparation for professional schools in medicine, public health, nursing, and law. In sum, an anthropology minor offers a holistic education that, regardless of the job attained after graduation, provides a perspective on humanity that inspires a lifetime of engagement with the issues of importance to our globalized society.",

Through engaging closely with these and other forms of visual expression, students develop crucial, transferable skills: visual analysis and interpretation, original research and careful argumentation, image-based thinking and communication, and clear and persuasive writing in a variety of modes. \n\nArt history prepares students for a variety of professional tracks: visual arts (e.g., art criticism, art appraisal and sales, art therapy, fashion, interior design, museums, and conservation), the humanities (e.g., grant writing, historic preservation, and philanthropy), media and marketing (e.g., advertising, film, journalism, radio, and television), K-12 and post-secondary education (e.g., teaching and administration), information science and collections management (e.g., libraries and archives in public, non-profit, and corporate contexts), and medicine and law.

You will also learn how to analyze ancient Mediterranean religions (Greek and Roman religion, ancient Israelite and Jewish religion, ancient Christianity and Islam). After some initial course requirements in one of several of our larger courses, students in the CNRC sub-plan take at least one course in each of three interrelated areas: State, Self, and Social Power; Literature and Intellectual History; and Religious Discourse, Authority, and Practice, along with two electives, which can include intermediate or advanced courses in language (Latin, Greek, Biblical Hebrew, or Modern Hebrew). The field of classical and Near Eastern religions and cultures is at the root of many varied disciplines and careers from law and communications to non-profit work and administration. Any career that requires the skills of careful, critical analysis, deep research and understanding of cultural systems, and insight into the motivations of a plurality of religious perspectives active in the world today will benefit from this major.

What can the similarities and differences found across human languages tell us about how language is stored and organized in our brains? What role does social context and other nonlinguistic factors play in how humans create meaning with language? \n\nNatural languages all involve a system of meaning (semantics), a system of externalization through speech or sign (phonology), and a grammatical system of sentence structure that links meaning and externalization (syntax). Students who major in Linguistics gain a strong background in the principles governing the structure of natural languages in all of these areas. Other coursework addresses the role of language in human cognition and social interaction, how languages change over time, computer understanding of natural languages, methods in language documentation and analysis, and other topics.\n\nCoursework and research activities in the Institute of Linguistics give our majors and minors both breadth and depth in linguistics, as well as opportunities to participate in cutting-edge linguistic research. Our graduates take their in-depth knowledge of how language works and their strong problem-solving skills to a variety of careers, including language policy and planning, language teaching, natural language processing and data science, publishing, translation and interpretation, advertising and branding. In addition, coursework in linguistics provides excellent preparation for graduate study in linguistics, NLP and computer science, and professional programs such as law and speech-language-hearing sciences.",

    "info": "If you have ever pondered, \"Why am I here?\" or \"What is the meaning of life?\" then you have already thought about philosophy. Philosophy poses questions about every human endeavor and examines our basic assumptions about everything we think we know. It takes on challenging issues that sometimes defy resolution and trains the brain to think in a rigorous and analytic way about all the possible answers and what's at stake. Philosophy is not just a subject matter but a way of thinking.\n\nIn your philosophy courses, you will learn about the way that people throughout history have engaged in this kind of thinking with questions such as \"Can I really trust my senses to tell me about reality?\" \"Is anything really morally right or wrong or is it all just relative?\" \"Do scientific theories tell us the truth about the world or are they tools that are useful for certain purposes?\" \"Are some societies more just than others?\" You will discover that thinking about these questions with an open mind is deeply satisfying. Philosophical thinking also contributes to a worthwhile life; in the words of Socrates, \"the unexamined life is not worth living.\"\n\nOf course, life isn't all about having fun thinking. Philosophy is also much more practical than you might think! Because philosophy is so far-reaching, the method it uses for study enhances the study of other fields such as art, math, science, language, and law with tremendous success. It is a great complement to other majors as a second major or a minor. You can find details about good combinations on our website. Also, studying philosophy is a fantastic way to hone your critical thinking and analytical writing skills. You'll learn two types of critical thinking: First, a method for rigorous analysis of arguments. Second, a habit of asking penetrating questions about the hidden assumptions of any position, ideology, or practice. You will develop your capacities to conceive of alternative assumptions, evaluate which ones are best and determine where they lead. You'll learn to write papers that clearly demonstrate these skills.\n\nThe philosophy minor is unstructured, but we recommend giving your minor program your own structure one that will enrich your major or allow you to explore a side interest in a concentrated way.

    "info": "Political science examines who gets what, when, and how from government. Political scientists study voters, politicians, interest groups, political parties, social movements, institutions, states, and public policies at all levels, from local communities to the global community. The discipline covers four thematic areas: American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, and Political Theory. Political scientists employ multiple tools to learn about politics, including historical methods, case studies, and statistical, archival, and critical analyses. Political science majors develop an array of skills acquired through coursework, research opportunities with individual faculty, and internships that open multiple career opportunities in public, private, and non-profit sectors.\n\nStudents of American Politics seek to understand the way that collective governance happens in the United States. The American Politics focus area is divided into two areas: Political Behavior is the study of public opinion and electoral behavior of voting age adults, and Political Institutions is the study of the formal and informal structures of governance in the United States. Students will learn how research projects are designed and, in some courses, how to collect, examine, and present data. \n\nIn Comparative Politics, we seek to identify factors that explain political outcomes across time and space, and closely examine patterns that transcend historical and geographic particularities. Although Comparative Politics is sometimes thought to refer to the study of politics outside the United States, comparativists reject the idea that American politics are not amenable to comparative analysis. Comparative Politics courses will make you a more informed and discerning citizen in our interconnected world.\n \nIn International Relations, we study how the countries of the world do and don't get along. We address fundamental questions of war and peace, conflict and cooperation, trade, migration, and finance. Taking courses in International Relations helps students better understand how the world works. Students will be expected to write policy memos, conduct independent research, take part in simulations and debates, and devise policy solutions to complicated challenges.\n\nPolitical Theory analyzes the meaning and significance of fundamental political concepts. Starting from foundational concerns as the nature of politics, humans, power and justice, theorists explore how these basic starting assumptions organize the norms, practices, and institutions of political and social order. Students who study Political Theory become more adept at critical thinking, careful reading and clear writing, and recognizing and constructing arguments. These skills are basic for the critical, lifelong role that all of us play as members of a political community.\n\nTaking classes across the focus areas enables students to become more informed citizens and to pursue a wide variety of careers. Political science majors learn skills including oral and written communication, analytical and critical thinking, problem solving, teamwork, and digital competencies.",

When you examine migration, not only will you study laws and non-governmental organizations analyses of mobility trends, but the geopolitical upheavals and food systems failures that drive these trends. And students will always keep in view the grassroots and community initiatives that address these problems on the ground, since that is where the impacts of these issues are most powerfully felt and creative solutions worked out. In short, Global Studies is a major for students who are committed both to understanding the world they live in and to making that world a better place.\n\nGlobal Studies courses traverse geography and time. Some analyze the workings of global institutions and explore the operations of the global health, food, and financial systems. Others use works of art and philosophy from around the world to expose students to cultural forms like indigenous art and prison literature. Still others explore long-term historical trajectories, such as the growth of global communications, media, and tourism industries. You will also have the opportunity to study abroad, intern, and engage deeply with on and off campus communities. In capstone projects you will bring together what you\u2019ve studied to define, explore, and create new visions of the world. You will learn both critical thinking and practice the empathy needed to construct global citizenship for the 21st century.\n\nAll learning experiences offer ample opportunities for developing the communications and organizational skills that support success in future careers in any number of sectors including nonprofits, government, and industry, as well as for graduate study in a number of arenas in law, policy, social sciences, and the humanities.",

Changes in the size and composition of populations, as well as in the underlying components of population change (i.e., mortality, fertility, and migration), strongly influence and are influenced by natural and human systems in ways that are increasingly consequential.\n\nPopulation studies equips students with the ability to connect to demography in ways that promote understanding, preparedness, leadership, and service in a period of rapid social change. This program draws from a rich set of resources at the University of Minnesota with a possible experience with the Minnesota Population Center (MPC) via internships, employment, or course offerings. \n\nCoursework focuses on the intersections of population studies with ecology, economics, education, environmental science, epidemiology, geography, history, political science, public health, public policy, sociology, and statistics. Faculty interests in the comparative study of demography and institutions in various countries add an international emphasis to these areas of study. All population studies courses emphasize the skills of social inquiry necessary for analyzing patterns of social relationships.\n\nFor those students who pursue completion of an advanced minor elective, the minor will also equip and credential undergraduates with highly marketable skills for employment in a range of business, government, and non-profit organizations. The population studies minor would help to qualify students and signal qualifications to employers for jobs such as data science and data management; research analysts in government and non-profit organizations focused on social services, urban planning, elder services, environmental stewardship, and resource management, family planning, health, transportation, and education; market analysts and consultants employing market forecasting based on demographic projections; and actuaries.",

Students explore the relationships among home, community, and school cultures for students of color, focusing on classroom contexts, but extending outside of school spaces to educational practices and insights of households and community organizations. Students partner with a school to produce critical digital media that address local issues of urban education. Students select additional core coursework in critical perspectives in education on either race, class, or language and in ethnic or gender studies classes. \n\nStudents who combine this minor with an undergraduate degree in liberal arts, sciences, or ethnic studies will position themselves to critically engage their communities on educational issues or for graduate work in secondary teacher licensure, educational policy, and other educational studies.",

A drug is defined as any foreign entity that exerts an effect on a biological system, whereas a therapeutic is a drug that is intentionally administered in order to elicit a favorable outcome. Investigators in the program in Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics (MPaT) focus on developing greater insight into the molecular mechanisms that determine biological responses to therapeutic agents, and how underlying biological variation impacts these responses. In addition, MPaT program faculty strive to develop a greater understanding of basic mechanisms of molecular biology, and in particular how these processes are altered in disease states. The ultimate objective of these latter studies is to gain insight that can lead to the development of future novel therapeutic agents. The MPaT graduate minor is designed to prepare students academically and professionally in the field of pharmacological research to make them competent as scientists and competitive as job candidates. Students who have earned their minor from this program occupy a diverse array of high-level positions in the fields of scientific research, drug development and discovery, and medical outreach. The MPaT graduate program consists of 74 faculty trainers, each of whom is equipped to offer students training in highly diverse research areas. Minor students can expect individualized mentorship and training from their advisors. For their part, students are expected to perform at a high level in the lab and classroom, produce publishable scientific data, and to adhere to the standards established by their advisor, the MPaT graduate program, the Department of Pharmacology, and the University.",
