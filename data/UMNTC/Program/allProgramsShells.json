    "info": "Anthropology is the study of humankind in all of its forms (cultural, biological, and linguistic), using a holistic and global perspective. It comprises four primary subfields: archaeology, biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and sociocultural anthropology, all of which are uniquely linked by the concept of culture.  \n\nAnthropology combines a set of theories and methods that have, at their core, the development of an understanding of human biological and cultural variability. It allows students to learn about the scientific, social, political, and historical perspectives on human variation and human evolution. It challenges them to examine their own beliefs, and come to their own conclusions, about the implications in today's world of biological and cultural variation, including how false narratives have been\u2014and continue to be\u2014perpetuated in order to oppress certain groups. Fundamentally, Anthropology therefore contributes to the liberal education of students at the University of Minnesota by tackling questions that are at the heart of societal tensions: how does identity relate to the biological and cultural factors that have shaped humans as a species and that continue to shape populations and individuals? Importantly, Anthropology as a reflexive discipline also examines its own legacy.  Many of our classes tackle the impact of colonialism, racism, and other actions and ideologies that serve to justify and perpetuate inequality.\n\nThe Bachelor of Science degree recognizes that many fields of study within biological anthropology and archaeology depend upon modes of inquiry based upon empirical scientific methods. It therefore develops competence in these scientific methods through curricular requirements within and outside Anthropology. Students pursuing this degree are required to take 20-24 credits outside Anthropology in a wide variety of courses within the Quantitative and Natural sciences. Within the major, students take numerous lab-based courses, in which they learn to ask scientific questions, design a research methodology, collect and analyze data, and use the results to refine the question. Non lab-based classes also strongly emphasize research skills, effective writing, and critical thought. \n\nThe BS degree provides an excellent foundation for a wide range of careers in anthropology, such as evolutionary anthropology, molecular anthropology, geo-archaeology, archaeological chemistry, and forensic anthropology.\n\nAdditionally, the BS degree enables students who are pursuing a career in the health sciences to fulfill the math and science prerequisites for medical school and other graduate programs in health, while gaining a solid foundation in anthropology. Although a second language is not required for the BS degree, cultural competency and an appreciation of the role of culture in how societies construct knowledge are gained through anthropological coursework at all levels.",

    "info": "Anthropology is the study of human beings and cultures throughout the world during the present and past. It is the study of who we are, and how we came to be that way. Anthropology is partly a natural science, partly a social science, and partly a humanistic study. Anthropology majors compare and contrast the biological, social, and cultural similarities and differences of humans and their societies across the globe and develop a sophisticated understanding of both the cultural diversity and the biological unity of our species. Perhaps more than with any other degree, Anthropology majors are known to possess unique observational and critical thinking skills and are aware of the role that culture plays in identity, relationships, and decision-making.\n\nStudents who major in the field are expected to take courses in the four sub-fields of anthropology. Students planning a professional career in anthropology general specialize in one of the sub-fields: biological anthropology (the evolutionary history of human and nonhuman primates), archaeology (the study of prehistoric and historic societies through their material culture), sociocultural anthropology (the study of the behavior of recent people in settings that range from unindustrialized societies to modern urban centers), and linguistic anthropology (the comparative study of languages and communication). The Anthropology Department website (http://cla.umn.edu/anthropology/ba-anthropology) offers several examples of course sequences designed to provide training in particular sub-fields. There are a variety of opportunities for graduates with degrees in anthropology. While some go on to graduate school in order to obtain a position in a university, most graduates find non-academic jobs in the private and public sectors. Private industry consulting, environmental firms, product development and marketing firms, as well as the nonprofit sector all employ anthropologists because of the unique observational and critical thinking skills they possess. Governmental agencies at the state and federal levels seek anthropologists for various positions. Biological anthropologists find employment as forensic scientists working for law enforcement. Archaeologists find jobs in cultural resource management (CRM) firms whose services are contracted by construction companies to ensure compliance with legislation pertaining to archaeological and historical preservation. \n\nAn anthropology major is also excellent preparation for professional schools in medicine, public health, nursing, and law. An anthropology major offers a holistic education that, regardless of the job attained after graduation, provides a perspective on humanity that inspires a lifetime of engagement with the issues of importance to our globalized society.",

The program admits students only for the PhD, although some students do earn a master's degree as part of their PhD program. \n\nMajor areas of faculty research and graduate student training in sociocultural and linguistic anthropology include art and visual culture, critical theory, queer theory, feminist theory, critical disability studies, environment, ecology, and the Anthropocene, cultures of capitalism, language and modernity, colonialism and imperialism, experimental writing, gender, race, and sexuality, medical anthropology, memory and haunting, religion, multi-species ethnography, new materialisms, legal and political anthropology, economic anthropology, anthropology of race and racism, philosophical anthropology, science and technology studies, sovereignty and the state, and temporality and futurity. Regional specializations include Europe, the Pacific, the Middle East, North America, the Caribbean, and East Asia.\n\nThe program in archaeology applies social and ecological theories to produce new anthropological insights into the roles of material culture and the environment in indigenous, prehistoric, and historical contexts. Our archaeologists apply a range of scientific methods in the field and the laboratory to understand human-environmental interactions in the past, and to advance knowledge of landscape use and site formation processes. Regional specializations include Europe, Asia, Latin America, and North America.\n\nThe program in biological anthropology offers training and research opportunities in two main areas: paleoanthropology and molecular anthropology. The paleoanthropology speciality combines biological anthropology, vertebrate paleobiology, and Paleolithic archaeology to interpret the evolution and behavior of hominins and other primates through the application of evolutionary theory to the analysis of skeletal morphology, faunal remains, community analysis, and site taphonomy. The molecular anthropology speciality studies the population history of humans by using ancient DNA and modern genomic methods to investigate processes such as migration, admixture, and adaptation, as well as historic trends in disease and health. Students also benefit from training and expertise in primate behavior and ecology, stable isotope paleoecology, phylogeography, geochronology, and phylogenetic methods through close collaborations and co-advising with faculty in other departments.",

    "info": "Anthropology is the study of human beings and cultures throughout the world during the present and past. It is the study of who we are, and how we came to be that way. Anthropology is partly a natural science, partly a social science, and partly a humanistic study. Anthropology minors learn to compare and contrast the biological, social, and cultural similarities and differences of humans and their societies across the globe and develop a sophisticated understanding of both the cultural diversity and the biological unity of our species.\n\nStudents who minor in the field are expected to take a minimum of one 1xxx-level course and four upper-level (3xxx or higher) courses that have a common focus. A common focus usually corresponds with one of the four sub-fields of anthropology: biological anthropology (the evolutionary history of human and nonhuman primates), archaeology (the study of prehistoric and historic societies through their material culture), sociocultural anthropology (the study of the behavior of recent people in settings that range from unindustrialized societies to modern urban centers), and linguistic anthropology (the comparative study of languages and communication). The Anthropology Department website (http://cla.umn.edu/anthropology/ba-anthropology) offers several examples of course sequences designed to provide training in particular sub-fields. A minor in anthropology provides many opportunities for graduates. It is seen as a useful degree within many businesses, for instance industry consulting, environmental consulting, product development, and marketing, as well as the nonprofit sector. Students with anthropology degrees are known to possess unique observational and critical thinking skills; and, perhaps more than with any other degree, they are aware of the role that culture plays in identity, relationships, and decision-making.\n\nAn anthropology minor is also excellent preparation for professional schools in medicine, public health, nursing, and law. In sum, an anthropology minor offers a holistic education that, regardless of the job attained after graduation, provides a perspective on humanity that inspires a lifetime of engagement with the issues of importance to our globalized society.",

The program exposes students to the formal, socio-cultural, material, environmental, and historical factors that shape built environments. The BS program fosters a sense of stewardship for local and global built environments by providing opportunities for students to engage with College of Design faculty and research centers, and to study abroad. Design education in the BS program is structured around six sequential semester-long design studios. Each studio is a focused study in one of architecture's core areas: \n1. Material assemblies \n2. Site and context\n3. Program and typology\n4. Advanced design\n5. Metropolitan design\n6. Design as research\nThrough hands-on making and complementary courses, students demonstrate how these core areas affect formal, spatial, and experiential qualities of architectural space.\n\nBS students develop visual literacy through design thinking and the development of design processes in design studios by engaging spatial representation in drawing courses, by researching historical precedents and theoretical texts in history and theory seminars, and by exploring concepts of sustainability and resilience in technology courses. Students are eligible to apply to the 2-year BS degree program from within the College of Design after completing all required first-year courses. \n\nAdmissions to the BS program is competitive, with a portfolio, transcripts, and an essay included in the application process. Students in the BS will take six required 6-credit design studios, a sequence of history/theory and building technology courses, and 9 credits of upper-level architecture electives. Graduates of the BS are well prepared to apply to the second year of the School of Architecture's master's of architecture graduate program; other paths include the professional master\u2019s of landscape architecture, the dual master\u2019s of urban planning, and the master's of science degree programs in sustainability, heritage preservation and conservation, and metropolitan design; as well as other graduate degree programs at peer institutions, per their admissions requirements.",

Through engaging with these and other forms of visual and material expression, majors develop crucial, transferable skills: visual analysis and interpretation, original research and careful argumentation, image-based thinking and communication, and clear and persuasive writing in a variety of modes.\n\nArt history majors' ability to critically evaluate sources, sharp communication skills, and nuanced understanding of diverse cultures make them natural creative thinkers, storytellers, and community advocates. Thanks to their powerful skill set, students of art history also go on to enjoy higher job satisfaction and lower unemployment rates over the course of their working lives than peers in vocational tracks.\n\nGraduates pursue careers in range of fields: the visual arts (e.g., art criticism, art appraisal and sales, art therapy, museums, and conservation), humanities (e.g., grant writing, historic preservation, and philanthropy), media and marketing (e.g., advertising, film, and journalism), K-12 and post-secondary education (e.g., teaching and administration), information science and collections management (e.g., libraries and archives in non-profit and corporate contexts), as well as medicine and law.\n\nArt history is the history of humanity's creative expression. Majors are therefore asked to fulfill a selection of distribution requirements, which, together, highlight continuities as well as differences across geographic regions and historical eras. To help students gain a more intimate understanding of the important role artistic processes play in knowledge production, the department also requires majors to take one studio art class.\n\nTypically spanning several centuries and continents, 1xxx-level courses provide a broad orientation to art historical topics and debates. 3xxx-level courses are also appropriate for students new to art history, offering introductions to specific subfields (e.g., the history of Chinese painting, the history of photography, etc.). Courses at the 5xxx-level offer more intimate, seminar-style learning experiences, the opportunity to explore focused topics, and pursue individual research under the guidance of faculty experts. Most courses have no prerequisites. This, combined with the total number of required credits, makes art history an especially attractive option for double-majors and transfer students. ",

    "info": "The biochemistry, molecular biology and biophysics (BMBB) graduate program is an interdisciplinary program that is supported by the College of Biological Sciences (CBS) and the Medical School of the University of Minnesota. The program provides a broad research-based education involving faculty from BMBB, as well as many faculty members from several other departments in CBS, the Medical School, the College of Science and Engineering (CSE), the College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resources Sciences (CFANS), and the College of Veterinary Medicine. \n\nBMBB focuses on determining the molecular mechanisms that underlie basic biological functions using an integrated approach that encompasses biochemistry, chemistry, biophysics, genomics, molecular biology, proteomics, and structural biology. Special emphasis is placed on revealing how biological processes go awry in diseases including cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and AIDS. The program has four areas of emphasis: synthetic biology and biotechnology, molecular biology, metabolic and systems biology, and chemical and structural biology. All students are expected to demonstrate a minimum level of competence in these areas, but will emphasize the area most related to their thesis project. \n\nWhile graduate training in a BMBB laboratory involves first-year coursework and associated preliminary examinations, the focal point for graduate education is thesis research. Laboratory-based exploration coupled with journal clubs, seminars, scientific meetings and retreats, career counseling, and scientific ethics constitutes the major components of the program. Support for graduate education comes from a variety of sources but is augmented by several NIH and NSF-based training grants. Most graduate students from the University of Minnesota obtain full-time employment immediately after graduation, or pursue advanced training in academic or corporate positions.\n\nStudents pursuing a degree in BMBB are only admitted to the PhD program (see note below) under the auspices of Molecular, Cellular and Structural Biology (MCSB), a first-year program administered by BMBB and the Molecular, Cellular, Developmental Biology and Genetics (MCDB&G) graduate programs.

The program provides a broad research-based education involving faculty from BMBB as well as many faculty members from several other departments in CBS, the Medical School, the College of Science and Engineering (CSE), the College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resources Sciences (CFANS), and the College of Veterinary Medicine. \n\nBMBB focuses on determining the molecular mechanisms that underlie basic biological functions using an integrated approach that encompasses biochemistry, chemistry, biophysics, genomics, molecular biology, proteomics, and structural biology. Special emphasis is placed on revealing how biological processes go awry in diseases including cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and AIDS. The program has four areas of emphasis: synthetic biology and biotechnology, molecular biology, metabolic and systems biology, and chemical and structural biology. All students are expected to demonstrate a minimum level of competence in these areas but will emphasize the area most related to their thesis project. \n\nWhile graduate training in a BMBB laboratory involves first-year coursework and associated preliminary examinations, the focal point for graduate education is thesis research. Laboratory-based exploration coupled with journal clubs, seminars, scientific meetings and retreats, career counseling and scientific ethics constitutes the major components of the program. Support for graduate education comes from a variety of sources but is augmented by several NIH and NSF-based training grants. PhD graduates from the University of Minnesota obtain full-time employment immediately after graduation or pursue advanced training in academic or corporate postdoctoral positions.\n\nStudents pursuing the PhD are admitted to BMBB under the auspices of Molecular, Cellular and Structural Biology (MCSB), a first year program administered by BMBB and the Molecular, Cellular, Developmental Biology and Genetics (MCDB&G) graduate programs. After the first year, students select either BMBB or MCDB&G to complete their degree. \n\nRelated PhD and MS programs in BMBB:\n\nAs a part of the BMBB program, graduate studies leading to a PhD degree may be pursued on the Duluth campus. A PhD in BMBB may also be obtained through the Combined MD-PhD program.

Civil engineers analyze, design, and supervise the construction of roads, buildings, water supply systems, airports, tunnels, dams, bridges, and wastewater treatment systems. They must consider many factors in the design process including regulations and policy issues, sustainability, fabrication costs and constructibility, expected lifetime of a project, and risk assessment of natural events and potential hazards. \n\nCivil engineering is a broad area of engineering and has a tangible impact on the quality of life, human health, and safety. The advances that civil engineers have made in providing clean water supply systems have had a greater impact on human health and longevity than many advances in the medical field. The structures we live and work in, the roads and bridges we drive on, the clean water we drink, and wastewater treatment systems we use, are all designed by civil engineers. Major specialties within civil engineering include construction, environmental, geotechnical, municipal, structural, transportation, and water resources engineering. \n\nCivil engineering jobs are available in both the private and public sector through consulting firms and in government agencies at the local, state, and federal levels. Employment can be found in nearly any region, from small communities and remote areas to the largest cities in the world. Graduates of the program have worked on the design of the tallest building and largest dams in the world. Civil engineering is considered to have one of the highest levels of job satisfaction of all professions. Civil engineers can enjoy a fulfilling technical career and also have opportunities for administrative and leadership positions. Many opportunities are available that allow civil engineers to spend time outdoors. The infrastructure required to sustainably maintain modern society ensures the continued demand for civil engineers. \n\nThe upper division civil engineering program requires students to take introductory courses in the major areas. In addition, students may emphasize in an area by selecting appropriate technical electives in consultation with their advisor. The infrastructure required to sustainably maintain modern society ensures the continued demand for civil engineers.\n\nThe program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org.",

You will also learn how to analyze ancient Mediterranean religions (Greek and Roman religion, ancient Israelite and Jewish religion, ancient Christianity and Islam). After some initial course requirements in one of several of our larger courses, students in the CNRC sub-plan take at least one course in each of three interrelated areas: State, Self, and Social Power; Literature and Intellectual History; and Religious Discourse, Authority, and Practice, along with two electives, which can include intermediate or advanced courses in language (Latin, Greek, Biblical Hebrew, or Modern Hebrew). The field of classical and Near Eastern religions and cultures is at the root of many varied disciplines and careers from law and communications to non-profit work and administration. Any career that requires the skills of careful, critical analysis, deep research and understanding of cultural systems, and insight into the motivations of a plurality of religious perspectives active in the world today will benefit from this major.

    "info": "French is now more widely spoken as a first language outside of France than within it and is the sixth most-commonly spoken language in the world. Studying French at the U of M takes you far beyond the stereotypes and basics. The major in French Studies introduces students to world cultures and history, preparing them for our interconnected, global future. The program cultivates students' cultural sophistication and their skills in language, communication, analysis, and argument. It opens doors and strengthens skills vital to today's careers. \n\nRecent research shows that employers prefer to hire employees who have double-majored as it often leads to more innovative thinking skills, making you more marketable. French is an ideal choice as a second major for almost any other major at the U. French Studies reinforces the kinds of skills Liberal Arts degrees are rightly heralded for, or can help develop parallel skills to majors in other colleges (Business, Science, Agriculture, Design), where critical thinking and communication skills can work together with analytical and practical skills developed from the other discipline. The vast majority of our majors are double majors, and graduates go on to successful careers in international fields or in education, law, medicine, or business. These students choose French as a second major, rather than a minor, because it allows them to reach a higher level of language proficiency while achieving a depth of cultural understanding that is not possible in the shorter program.\n\nStudents who join our department will quickly discover that this idea of combining disciplines is well-entrenched in our faculty and course offerings, which sets us apart from many language departments that focus more on traditional approaches to the discipline. Our faculty are deeply committed to research in fields such as film and the moving image, genocide studies, representations of the body, disability studies, gender and queer studies, migration, and more. All of our elective courses relate to one or more of our primary themes: language/linguistics; thought/philosophy; gender/sexuality; media/visual/ performance studies; contemporary global/intercultural perspectives; historic global/intercultural perspectives. Students can easily take the variety of elective courses that most closely align with their other major, allowing the majors to complement each other to their greatest effect.\n\nSome nuts and bolts: Students must complete FREN 1501/2, and at least four 3xxx-level courses totaling 12 credits, on the UMN TC campus. They can transfer many courses from study abroad. We accept appropriate coursework (agreed upon with a departmental advisor before going abroad) from our Montpellier programs, the Senegal MSID program, and others. The majority of our majors do study abroad, if even just in a shorter-term summer program, and these experiences are almost always a life highlight.",

There is no one way to be a geographer; climate scientists, ecologists, economists, planners, data scientists, and scholars of race and gender have all found their home in a field that builds an integrative approach to problem-solving. Geographers are skilled observers of the world who possess unique critical thinking skills and are attuned to the role that space, place, and environment play in everyday life.\n\nThe B.S. in Geography will provide you with scientific skills to understand your world and its conjoined social, spatial, and environmental processes. It offers you an area of specialization, enhances your quantitative analytical skills, and encourages engagement with a range of cognate sciences. \n\nStudents follow one of two tracks:\n\nEnvironmental Geography students study natural environments and systems, both in themselves and as they relate to human beings. Some of the focus areas of our Environmental Geography track are:\n- Climate and Paleoclimate. How do humans affect the climate? What was climate like in the past, and how can we learn from it as we plan for the future? \n- Changing Environment. What places are most prone to fire, flooding, and other hazards, and why? How have human land management decisions altered the evolution and functioning of biophysical landscapes?\n- Biogeography, Sustainability, and Conservation. Why do animal and plant populations grow, shrink, or shift ranges as global temperatures change? How do species transform the makeup of environmental systems? \n\nGeographic Information Science combines digital data with cutting-edge computational approaches and theories to advance our knowledge of natural and societal phenomena and processes.\n- Geographic Information Science develops technologies to gather, manipulate, and analyze spatial data, ranging from centuries-old mapping methods to new approaches like artificial intelligence and big data.\n- The GIS and society focus examines interactions between social systems and technologies and how they shape each other.\n- Urban spatial analysis uses various technologies to determine how to serve different people and many different needs, such as locating facilities, planning transportation routes, and planning services. \n- Spatial health and epidemiology use spatial analysis methods to examine the social and environmental determinants of human well-being.\n\nA wide variety of career options are open to students with a B.S. in Geography. Local, regional, and federal agencies seek geographers for positions in natural resource management, environmental conservation and restoration, city and regional planning, transportation, and community development.

There is no one way to be a geographer: climate scientists, ecologists, economists, planners, and scholars of race and gender, all find their home in a field that builds an integrative approach to problem-solving.\n\nGeographers integrate theory and method from the social sciences, natural sciences, data sciences, and humanities to solve pressing contemporary issues. What roles do geographies of social difference play in constructing and resisting power structures? Why is it important to understand struggles over the meaning of common lands and other natural resources? How can we design cities to be more affordable, humane, healthy, and sustainable? Why does climate change vary from place to place and who is impacted by these changes? And how might we employ GIS technologies to determine how to serve different people and different needs in our communities, such as by locating facilities, planning transportation routes, and planning services?\n\nStudents who major or double-major in Geography build expertise that matches their interests and pursue many professional trajectories. Students usually choose a theme:\n\n- Urban Geography fosters critical and creative thinking on the social-spatial processes and patterns that lead to and result from humans (and nonhumans) living together in cities.\n- Environment, Health, and Society examines the intersection between the human and natural world and the way those intersections impact communities, human health, and natural environments.\n- Political Economy and Development looks at how economic relationships and power differentials result in diverging life conditions for populations across the world.\nEnvironmental Geography studies interconnected components of our natural environment\u2014atmosphere, geosphere, hydrosphere, biosphere\u2014and how they interact across space and time.\n- Geographic Information Science (GIS) uses digital data with computational methods and theory to analyze and visualize geospatial issues of social and environmental significance.\n- Geographies of Justice cuts across all subfields and explores how people and communities organize to achieve social and environmental justice in a world marked by economic and racial inequalities.\n\nYou can build on these foci in a number of related disciplines. For examples, please visit z.umn.edu/geogfoci.\n\nThe Geography B.A. prepares students for numerous rewarding career paths. While some go on to graduate school in order to obtain a position in a university, most graduates find jobs in the private and public sectors. Geographers obtain positions in land use and natural resource planning agencies, environmental consulting firms, housing, retail, and transportation sectors, and the non-profit sector.",

Asking interesting questions about the past and examining a range of oral, written, visual, and material sources, history majors explore and explain how peoples across time and space have lived, loved, built community, warred, reconciled, and made sense of their worlds. Deep analysis invites new understandings of the past and the peoples, movements, ideas, technologies, and organisms propelling change. As much as history is a window into the past, it also helps us understand ourselves, our identities, and how we have come to inhabit the moral, ethical, social, economic, political, religious, national, environmental, ethnic, racial, gender, and sexual communities we live in today. History helps us understand how our present and possible futures grow out of a very usable and interesting past. \n\nHistory majors develop all of the skills required to thrive in today's world from an understanding of the engines of change and an ability to assess and interpret conflicting evidence and arguments, to robust oral and written communication skills that will allow you to shape the conversations in your professions and communities. History majors bring powerful skill sets into the world and many go into the legal and medical professions, become business people or scientists, are journalists and teachers, work in the civil or foreign service, run for office, or work in the arts or non-profit sector. Regardless of your career path, a history major will enable you to bring a fresh and critical historical perspective to the communities you live and work in. Historical thinking strengthens communities by encouraging them to think deeply about where they have come from and where they would like to go. This is an incredible time to declare a history major. \n\nMany history majors are double majors. A history major is well paired with the study of political science, economics, sociology, psychology, global studies, journalism, education, foreign languages, biology, math, and engineering. History is a very popular double major due to the broad range of courses offered by our faculty. Students are invited to study local, national, comparative, and global histories, which fascinate them and frequently provide the type of deep contextualization that complements other areas of study.",

The MLA program is an interdisciplinary three-year degree accredited by the Landscape Architecture Accreditation Board (LAAB). The curriculum introduces students to the practice and discipline of landscape architecture, providing them with the knowledge, methods, and skills required to practice as landscape architects. Our MLA program prepares students to analyze the complex challenges facing urban, suburban, and rural communities and to envision sustainable designs at multiple scales across human and ecological systems. These challenges include water scarcity and water quality, climate change, species extinction, riverine flooding, and environmental injustice. Students address these challenges through planning and designing interventions that create resilient landscapes that manage increasingly scarce social and natural resources. Our urban location and proximity to the Mississippi River and Great Lakes region enables students to explore landscape change across a wide range of physical and political jurisdictions and to learn from the work of local experts to shift environmental, economic, planning, and development policies and practices to create more just, healthy, and sustainable communities.\n\nLandscape architecture is rooted in ethical notions of \u201cgood\u201d and \u201cright\u201d and landscape architects are legally bound to serve \u201cthe public good.\u201d Throughout our coursework, students consider the often conflicting values that underlie the built environment. For instance, in Landscape History, we ask how places are shaped and reshaped over time in response to cultural, political, environmental, and economic shifts and why certain landscapes are considered historically significant. In research methods, we ask whose knowledge counts when it comes to land use decision-making. In planting design and ecology courses, we ask what is \u201cnatural\u201d or \u201cnative\u201d and do we mean by \u201crestoration.\u201d The core of the MLA includes six design studios that are supported by courses in construction technologies and materials, planting and ecology, media and representation (including geographic information systems), history, and research methods. The studio sequence begins with small-scale local sites where intensive field investigations are critical to the design process. Second- and third-year option studios travel outside the state to investigate issues like climate change and sea-level rise, remediation of polluted sites, and restoration of ecological function. The program culminates in the capstone studio where students develop and research projects on the topic of their choosing.\n\nMLA students are encouraged to explore graduate minors or dual degrees. Applicants with accredited professional baccalaureate degrees in landscape architecture or architecture will be considered for advanced standing. ",

What can the similarities and differences found across human languages tell us about how language is stored and organized in our brains? What role does social context and other nonlinguistic factors play in how humans create meaning with language? \n\nNatural languages all involve a system of meaning (semantics), a system of externalization through speech or sign (phonology), and a grammatical system of sentence structure that links meaning and externalization (syntax). Students who major in Linguistics gain a strong background in the principles governing the structure of natural languages in all of these areas. Other coursework addresses the role of language in human cognition and social interaction, how languages change over time, computer understanding of natural languages, methods in language documentation and analysis, and other topics.\n\nCoursework and research activities in the Institute of Linguistics give our majors and minors both breadth and depth in linguistics, as well as opportunities to participate in cutting-edge linguistic research. Our graduates take their in-depth knowledge of how language works and their strong problem-solving skills to a variety of careers, including language policy and planning, language teaching, natural language processing and data science, publishing, translation and interpretation, advertising and branding.

    "info": "Linguistics is the study of the human capacity for language. What properties of the human mind allow us to learn and use language in a way that is unique to us as a species? What can the similarities and differences found across human languages tell us about how language is stored and organized in our brains? What role does social context and other nonlinguistic factors play in how humans create meaning with language? \n\nNatural languages all involve a system of meaning (semantics), a system of externalization through speech or sign (phonology), and a grammatical system of sentence structure that links meaning and externalization (syntax). Students who major in Linguistics gain a strong background in the principles governing the structure of natural languages in all of these areas. Other coursework addresses the role of language in human cognition and social interaction, how languages change over time, computer understanding of natural languages, methods in language documentation and analysis, and other topics.\n\nCoursework and research activities in the Institute of Linguistics give our majors and minors both breadth and depth in linguistics, as well as opportunities to participate in cutting-edge linguistic research. Our graduates take their in-depth knowledge of how language works and their strong problem-solving skills to a variety of careers, including language policy and planning, language teaching, natural language processing and data science, publishing, translation and interpretation, advertising and branding. In addition, coursework in linguistics provides excellent preparation for graduate study in linguistics, NLP and computer science, and professional programs such as law and speech-language-hearing sciences.",

BA majors are assigned to a faculty advisor based on their interests in music and career goals. Together they develop an appropriate trajectory of course selections that support the student's aspirations in the study of music and career objectives.\n\nStudents who pursue the music BA choose to specialize in one of two sub-plans: academic emphasis or applied emphasis.\n \nApplied Emphasis (see sample plan)\nThe BA in music with applied emphasis is for students seeking a liberal arts degree that embraces both applied study on a primary instrument in lesson and ensemble courses with the flexibility of elective coursework and foundational studies in music theory, musicology, keyboarding. This degree affords students the opportunity to hone performance skills and gain an increased knowledge of applied pedagogy. This emphasis requires a School of Music entrance application and audition.\n\nAcademic Emphasis (see sample plan)\nThe BA in music with an academic emphasis is designed for students who want a liberal arts education with significant rigor in the academic study of music. Students will focus on music theory, music history, world music, and choose a program concentration in an academic music field. While emphasis does not require a School of Music entrance audition, students need to complete a brief Statement of Interest after meeting with a School of Music representative during the major declaration process in order to be paired with a faculty advisor.\n\nProgram Advising\nDue the nuances unique to the discipline and study of music, students must work in close consultation on a semesterly basis with the department advisor to ensure adequate and timely degree progress. Music programs involve careful sequencing of core courses and applied music study to progressively build musical competencies and techniques.

Philosophy is not just a subject matter but a way of thinking. \n\nIn your philosophy courses, you will learn about the way that people throughout history have engaged in this kind of thinking with questions such as \"Can I really trust my senses to tell me about reality?\" \"Is anything really morally right or wrong or is it all just relative?\" \"Do scientific theories tell us the truth about the world or are they tools that are useful for certain purposes?\" \"Are some societies more just than others?\" You will discover that thinking about these questions with an open mind is deeply satisfying. Philosophical thinking also contributes to a worthwhile life; in the words of Socrates, \"the unexamined life is not worth living.\"\n\nOf course, life isn't all about having fun thinking. Philosophy is also much more practical than you might think! Because philosophy is so far-reaching, the method it uses for study enhances the study of other fields such as art, math, science, language, and law with tremendous success. It is a great complement to other majors as a second major or a minor. You can find details about good combinations on our website. Also, studying philosophy is a fantastic way to hone your critical thinking and analytic writing skills. You'll learn two types of critical thinking: First, a method for rigorous analysis of arguments. Second, a habit of asking penetrating questions about the hidden assumptions of any position, ideology, or practice. You will develop your capacities to conceive of alternative assumptions, evaluate which ones are best and determine where they lead. You'll learn to write papers that clearly demonstrate these skills. \n\nAnd finally, you can reassure your parents about your choice of philosophy with the fact that the skills of critical thinking and analytic writing are highly desirable and sought by graduate programs and employers. Evidence of this includes: \n- PHIL majors rank first among all majors in law school acceptance rate: 82.4%. \n- PHIL majors rank first among all majors in verbal and analytic sections of the GRE (and first among humanities majors in the quantitative section) \n- PHIL majors score higher on the Graduate Management Admissions Test (the test that most MBA programs require) than students in any business major (management, finance, accounting, marketing, etc.)\n- PHIL majors' salaries increase more over 10 years than most other majors, including marketing and accounting (The Wall Street Journal). \n- \"The present value of the extra earnings that graduates in humanities majors can expect over their lifetime is $444,700 for English majors, $537,800 for history majors, and $658,900 for philosophy majors\" (Forbes).",

    "info": "Political science examines who gets what, when, and how from government. Political scientists study voters, politicians, interest groups, political parties, social movements, institutions, states, and public policies at all levels, from local communities to the global community. The discipline covers four thematic areas: American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, and Political Theory. Political scientists employ multiple tools to learn about politics, including historical methods, case studies, and statistical, archival, and critical analyses. Political science majors develop an array of skills acquired through coursework, research opportunities with individual faculty, and internships that open multiple career opportunities in public, private, and non-profit sectors.\n\nStudents of American Politics seek to understand the way that collective governance happens in the United States. The American Politics focus area is divided into two areas: Political Behavior is the study of public opinion and electoral behavior of voting age adults, and Political Institutions is the study of the formal and informal structures of governance in the United States. Students will learn how research projects are designed and, in some courses, how to collect, examine, and present data. \n\nIn Comparative Politics, we seek to identify factors that explain political outcomes across time and space with an eye to patterns that transcend historical and geographic particularities. Although Comparative Politics is sometimes thought to refer to the study of politics outside the United States, comparativists reject the idea that American politics are not amenable to comparative analysis. Comparative Politics courses will make you a more informed and discerning citizen in our interconnected world.\n \nIn International Relations, we study how the countries of the world do and don't get along. We address fundamental questions of war and peace, conflict and cooperation, trade, migration, and finance. Taking courses in International Relations helps students better understand how the world works. Students will be expected to write policy memos, conduct independent research, take part in simulations and debates, and devise policy solutions to complicated challenges.\n\nPolitical Theory analyzes the meaning and significance of fundamental political concepts. Starting from foundational concerns as the nature of politics, humans, power and justice, theorists explore how these basic starting assumptions organize the norms, practices, and institutions of political and social order. Students who study Political Theory become more adept at critical thinking, careful reading and clear writing, and recognizing and constructing arguments. These skills are basic for the critical, lifelong role that all of us play as members of political community.\n\nTaking classes across the focus areas enables students to become more informed citizens and to pursue a wide variety of careers. Political science majors learn skills including oral and written communication, analytical and critical thinking, problem solving, teamwork, and digital competencies.",

    "info": "Political science examines who gets what, when, and how from government. Political scientists study voters, politicians, interest groups, political parties, social movements, institutions, states, and public policies at all levels, from local communities to the global community. The discipline covers four thematic areas: American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, and Political Theory. Political scientists employ multiple tools to learn about politics, including historical methods, case studies, and statistical, archival, and critical analyses. Political science majors develop an array of skills acquired through coursework, research opportunities with individual faculty, and internships that open multiple career opportunities in public, private, and non-profit sectors.\n\nStudents of American Politics seek to understand the way that collective governance happens in the United States. The American Politics focus area is divided into two areas: Political Behavior is the study of public opinion and electoral behavior of voting age adults, and Political Institutions is the study of the formal and informal structures of governance in the United States. Students will learn how research projects are designed and, in some courses, how to collect, examine, and present data. \n\nIn Comparative Politics, we seek to identify factors that explain political outcomes across time and space, and closely examine patterns that transcend historical and geographic particularities. Although Comparative Politics is sometimes thought to refer to the study of politics outside the United States, comparativists reject the idea that American politics are not amenable to comparative analysis. Comparative Politics courses will make you a more informed and discerning citizen in our interconnected world.\n \nIn International Relations, we study how the countries of the world do and don't get along. We address fundamental questions of war and peace, conflict and cooperation, trade, migration, and finance. Taking courses in International Relations helps students better understand how the world works. Students will be expected to write policy memos, conduct independent research, take part in simulations and debates, and devise policy solutions to complicated challenges.\n\nPolitical Theory analyzes the meaning and significance of fundamental political concepts. Starting from foundational concerns as the nature of politics, humans, power and justice, theorists explore how these basic starting assumptions organize the norms, practices, and institutions of political and social order. Students who study Political Theory become more adept at critical thinking, careful reading and clear writing, and recognizing and constructing arguments. These skills are basic for the critical, lifelong role that all of us play as members of a political community.\n\nTaking classes across the focus areas enables students to become more informed citizens and to pursue a wide variety of careers. Political science majors learn skills including oral and written communication, analytical and critical thinking, problem solving, teamwork, and digital competencies.",

A public health approach is grounded in social justice and emphasizes addressing challenges at the systems level with a focus on prevention and population health. Graduates will have an academic and experiential background that prepares them to understand, critically evaluate, and impact current and emerging challenges to the health of our global society.\n\nSpecifically, graduates from this program will be able to describe the foundational principles of public health, be able to understand basic methods for gathering and analyzing public health data (through surveillance and research), demonstrate understanding of how public health and social justice share common goals, and be able to communicate in both community and professional settings. This junior-admitting program prepares graduates for entry-level positions in the public health workforce with employment at local health departments, not-for-profit agencies, healthcare systems, or standalone research entities.

The Bachelor of Arts (BA) program in Speech-Language-Hearing sciences (SLHS) stands as an internationally recognized, comprehensive, science-based degree program that offers students a broad liberal arts education in an interdisciplinary field of study. \n\nThe curriculum of SLHS encompasses the physical, biological, and socio-behavioral aspects that influence the production and comprehension of speech and language. While these processes are often taken for granted, disruptions caused by disease, birth-related issues, or aging can significantly impact an individual's life. The field of speech-language-hearing sciences defines the parameters of normal and disordered communication, laying the research foundation for diagnosing and treating communication disorders. The SLHS program uniquely merges science, language, and communication, offering students exceptional academic preparation. It caters to those interested in physical and biological sciences, providing insights into linguistic, psychological, and neurophysiological theories and methods for diagnosing and treating voice, speech, language, and hearing disorders throughout a person's lifespan. This foundational knowledge opens pathways to diverse career opportunities, including roles such as speech-language pathologist, audiologist, psychologist, therapist, counselor, vocal coach, researcher, instructor, manager, or director in related fields. \n\nThe program requirements for the SLHS major fulfill a number of the University\u2019s Liberal Education (LE) requirements. Major students also have multiple options to meet the LE requirement by taking courses in related fields such as psychology, education, humanities, and social sciences. The SLHS major encourages exploration of the discipline through classes, research laboratories, and clinical observations. The major project course provides students with a service-learning opportunity, allowing hands-on experience and the application of learned concepts in a real-world setting. Collaborating with over 300 non-profit organizations in the community, students actively contribute to meaningful projects.",

The program does not lead to a state teaching certificate or licensure (note that a university certificate program or certificate is distinct from a state certificate or certification). \n\nIn Minnesota and other states in the US, dual language/immersion teachers at the elementary level are required to hold a teaching license in elementary education, and at the secondary level a license in the subject matter they teach (e.g., science, social studies, math). The University of Minnesota offers an initial teacher licensure program in elementary education with a focus on dual language and immersion education. \n\nThe dual language and immersion education certificate program is designed for preK-12 teachers and other professionals to be able to work effectively in the following school-based program models: \n- \"One-way\" foreign language immersion programs designed for native English-speaking students \n- \"Two-way\" bilingual immersion programs designed for native English-speaking students and native speakers of the program's partner language, such as Spanish \n- Developmental bilingual programs designed for minority language learners, such as native Spanish speakers \n- Indigenous language immersion programs designed for Native American children in indigenous communities with the goal of revitalizing an endangered language and culture \n\nIn dual language and immersion programs, the second/foreign/minority language that students are acquiring is a vehicle to teach school subjects. In order to be considered a dual language or immersion program, the immersion language must be used for at least 50 percent of subject-matter instruction during the elementary school years. In a middle/secondary continuation program, at least two, year-long content courses must be taught in the immersion language. \n\nThese programs aim for \"additive bilingualism and biliteracy,\" or the acquisition of another language at no expense to the first, native language. \n\nThis unique University certificate program incorporates a coherent set of courses designed specifically for dual language and immersion teachers, and other professionals. Offered by the college's Department of Curriculum and Instruction (C&I), the program was designed jointly by the college's Second Language Education faculty, and representatives of dual language and immersion programs in the Twin Cities metropolitan area.",

The BSE major is built on the idea that problems of biology, health, and the environment emerge at the intersection of natural and human systems. To understand these problems and their solutions, and to build skill sets to address them, requires that students have experience in the biological and natural sciences as well as in the social sciences and humanities.\n\nThe BSE degree provides a flexible curriculum that allows students to focus the degree to fit their personal, intellectual and professional goals. The BSE degree can prepare students for a wide variety of careers including laboratory science, environmental testing, health and environmental policy, public health, science education, and science communication, as well as a variety of academic and professional graduate programs.\n\nThe BSE major is an excellent choice for students interested in pursuing work in the health professions. Students can design their BSE major to provide the foundational science coursework necessary for their choice of M.D., D.D.S., Pharm.D., R.N., O.T., P.T. and PA programs. Medical programs are increasingly looking for students who have an education that includes social sciences and the humanities. BSE includes courses that help students understand the relationship of a diverse society to our medical system and provides students with the opportunity to think about health not just as an attribute of the biology of the body, but also as a complicated outcome of how different bodies relate to economic, cultural, and social systems.\n\nCourse work in BSE offers students the opportunity to study scientific practices and social and environmental problems. Just as importantly, students have the opportunity to:\n- Develop critical thinking skills and creative approaches to understanding such practices and problems using an array of conceptual and theoretical frameworks.\n- Consider the ethical issues inherent to both practices and problems and solutions.\n- Enhance their ability to communicate, particularly through writing.\n- Work as a team member to bridge disciplinary and institutional divisions.\n- Develop language skills to help them better engage with their own diverse communities or to open up opportunities for international work.\n\nResearch is a regular part of the BSE curriculum, and students are encouraged to work with the BSE adviser to find opportunities to work directly with faculty on their research or to find a faculty member to supervise a research project developed by the student. \n\nThere are a huge number of courses that count for the BSE major. It can be tricky to understand what is available. To see what is available semester by semester, students should look at the BSE course guide published each semester by the BSE advising office. Students can find the course guide on our webpage at z.umn.edu/BSEcourse. \n\nIf you are having trouble navigating the catalog and your APAS, a one page guide to BSE requirements can be found at z.umn.edu/BSEchecklist.",

This umbrella program has 2 tracks based on desired outcomes. The Medical Track, 1-year (3 semesters) Plan B MS, provides relevant, specialized content and experiences for students interested in health professions. The Research Track is a 2-year Plan A MS with research thesis that provides targeted training and research experiences on biomedical sciences. The mission of the Gateways MS Program is to recruit and train diverse students that upon graduation will enrich the region with their newly gained expertise. The Gateways MS Program will be a natural fit for regional students who wish to further their\neducation in a small city close to nature and home. We will focus on recruiting students that are: 1) Indigenous, 2) rural low income, or 3) other BIPOC/underrepresented in medicine (URM) and STEM. Training a diverse healthcare and research workforce will alleviate a historic lack of opportunities for underserved populations. In accordance with historical\nresponsibilities, mission-fit students will be eligible for scholarships to offset tuition costs. To support our students, we will build a culturally inclusive environment that promotes awareness and respect for all students. We will recruit students from diverse pre-med, STEM, and behavioral science disciplines. Students with other majors are encouraged to apply with a description of how their experiences will enrich the program. Graduation requirement will be completion of 30 credits in 1 or 2 years. Credits are earned in discussion-based classes, problem-based learning (PBL), bench research (Research Track only) along with relevant professional experiences and community projects. The active learning,\ninnovative curricula are tailored for each track around the science of human physiology and disease. This content will appeal to students interested in: (1) health professions (new applicants and near misses), (2) exploration of academic careers in biomedical research, (3)\nbiotechnology/pharmaceutical industry, (4) teaching health sciences, or (5) broader science applications in business, regulatory affairs, entrepreneurship, writing, or policy. The curriculum will be delivered by experienced faculty who teach the foundational content of the Duluth Regional Medical School (DMED) under a distinctive high contact-high content model. The Medical Track consists of a 3-semester, structured curriculum with clinical and community experiences and dedicated MCAT prep time. The Research Track offers multiple electives and bench skills with experienced mentors in exciting research areas, including neuroscience, genetics and genomics, cancer biology, immunology, physiology, and parasitology.",

All population studies courses emphasize the skills of social inquiry necessary for analyzing patterns of social relationships.\n\nFor those students who pursue completion of an advanced minor elective, the minor will also equip and credential undergraduates with highly marketable skills for employment in a range of business, government, and non-profit organizations. The population studies minor would help to qualify students and signal qualifications to employers for jobs such as data science and data management; research analysts in government and non-profit organizations focused on social services, urban planning, elder services, environmental stewardship, and resource management, family planning, health, transportation, and education; market analysts and consultants employing market forecasting based on demographic projections; and actuaries.",

As a land grant institution, the University has a mission to contribute to the state's communities, and the major will help fulfill that mission. The department also prioritizes local American Indian community engagement and advocacy. One of the single best ways to create positive change within our communities is to instill pride and celebrate cultural traditions like language at an early age. \n\nWhat distinguishes this program from any other is our use of both academically rigorous grammatical instruction (supported by linguistic research) coupled with the use of immersion techniques inside the classroom. This method has proven to be a very powerful combination in helping our students reach a high level of proficiency in the Ojibwe language. Students who complete the program to attain this high proficiency will have the foundational skills to contribute to Ojibwe language community building by bringing the Ojibwe language back into the home, to go into the high-demand field of immersion teaching, and to work in language preservation programs. With this major, students will:\n\n1) Be more prepared to fill an ever-growing need for immersion teacher positions.\n2) Graduate with a more sophisticated knowledge of the Ojibwe language in general.\n3) Graduate with the prestige that comes of having earned a bachelor's degree in the Ojibwe language.\n4) Have more time to increase their fluency under instructor supervision.\n5) Increase their knowledge of immersion pedagogy.\n6) Earn a bachelor's degree in the Ojibwe language (rather than a certificate) thereby increasing both their Ojibwe language credentials and earning potential upon graduation.",

Through exploration of ancient literature, archaeological sites, artifacts, inscriptions, and manuscripts, students learn about major historical figures (e.g., Egyptian rulers, Alexander the Great, Cicero, Socrates and Plato, Jesus, Moses, Mohammed, Roman Emperors, etc.), fascinating ancient literature (e.g., Homer's Iliad  and Odyssey, the Epic of Gilgemesh, Plato's Apology and Symposium, Euripides's Prometheus Bound and Bacchae, poetry by Catullus and Virgil, the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, the Quran, etc.), and everyday ancient social realities (e.g., family, gender, status, economy, politics, agriculture, religious practice, sanctuaries, magic, etc.). You will also learn how to analyze ancient Mediterranean religions (Greek and Roman religion, ancient Israelite and Jewish religion, ancient Christianity and Islam). After some initial course requirements in one of several of our larger courses, students in the CNRC sub-plan take courses in three interrelated areas: State, Self, and Social Power; Literature and Intellectual History; and Religious Discourse, Authority, and Practice. Students in the Languages and Literature subplan take specific introductory courses and then can go on to study Greek, Latin, or Modern Hebrew. The field of classical and Near Eastern religions and cultures is at the root of many varied disciplines and careers from law and communications to non-profit work and administration. Any career that requires the skills of careful, critical analysis, deep research and understanding of cultural systems, and insight into the motivations of a plurality of religious perspectives active in the world today will benefit from this major.

    "diploma": "Master of Arts",
    "info": "Health coaching is an emerging method of partnering with clients/patients to help them achieve their overall goals. Integrative health coaches practice from a holistic perspective that views the client as intrinsically healthy, whole, wise, and the ultimate expert in their own well-being journey. Health coaches do not diagnose or treat illness but assist those with health conditions to make meaningful changes in their lives to enhance their overall well-being. While an individual may make some changes alone, many changes happen more easily within the structure and support of a partnership, which can be uniquely provided by a health coach. This assistance includes necessary connection to resources, and the assembly of an optimal, interprofessional healthcare team. The ability to perform this role requires that health coaches have a comfortable working knowledge of both conventional and integrative healthcare. \n\nThe Earl E. Bakken Center for Spirituality & Healing is a pioneer in the health coaching field, working to advance education, research, and care model innovation. The Master of Arts in Integrative Health and Wellbeing Coaching was the first master's level health coaching degree to be offered through an accredited university in the United States. Graduates of the program work in a multitude of practice settings, including hospitals, clinics, health educational facilities, community centers, senior living centers, fitness venues, corporations, schools, and private practice.\n\nAll required coursework is offered in a blended format that combines online curriculum with in-person intensives. Students are required to be on campus one extended weekend per semester during year one. The program requires a set of core coaching classes, with additional coursework in health behavioral change theory, mind-body science, trauma-informed mental health, leadership, evidence-based decision-making, principles of management in health services organizations or coaching for chronic conditions, and group health coaching. One credit of elective coursework rounds out the degree, which gives students the opportunity to take other CSPH courses. Students may also use the credit to satisfy requirements for a minor in another department. Students finish the program with a 3-credit internship. \n\nThe Bakken Center for Spirituality & Healing Integrative Health Coaching programs are approved by the National Board for Health and Wellness Coaching (NBHWC) (https://nbhwc.org). The Bakken Center has been a national leader in defining the scope of practice, developing educational competencies and standards of practice, and helping to lead the creation of a national certification process and exam in Health and Wellness coaching. \n\nAlthough the instruction is based on research in the field, this Plan B degree is not intended to provide intensive research training and is understood to be a terminal degree.

These aspects include the causal mechanisms underlying behaviors (i.e., genetic, hormonal, neuronal, neuromodulatory, and sensory mechanisms), changes in behaviors over the animal's lifetime (i.e., during development or through learning), the adaptive value of behaviors (i.e., their contribution to survival and reproduction), and the evolutionary history of behaviors (i.e., how they change over evolutionary timescales). Consequently, the range of disciplines informing the study of behavioral biology is exceedingly broad and includes cell and developmental biology, endocrinology, ecology, economics, evolution, genetics, neuroscience, physiology, and psychology. Basic research in behavioral biology informs a diverse array of applied sciences, from conservation biology to robotics, animal science, biomedical science, and veterinary medicine. Consistent with this breadth, the behavioral biology minor is an interdisciplinary curriculum through which students learn foundational concepts of behavioral biology and gain perspectives about basic and applied issues involving the biology of animal behavior. Students will have the flexibility to tailor coursework to meet their own professional and career goals. Through a combination of courses, laboratories, and research opportunities, students who complete the minor will gain knowledge and skills that will enrich their lives and provide a base for subsequent work or study in the many fields touched by behavioral biology.",

They provide the navigation essential for controlling the course of scientific and societal advances.\n\nThe statistical practice BA is intended for students who want to use their education as certification for work requiring data scientific and statistical skills or as a basis for further education in another area like medicine, psychology, law, journalism, public policy, or other areas. There are two subplans (one of which must be selected).\n\nOne subplan is in Applied Statistics. This subplan can be compared easily to the Statistics BS degree, where the former reduces the number of required mathematics courses and increases the number of applied statistics courses, or courses in a supporting quantitative area. Students who complete this program using statistics electives will have applied statistics training equivalent to most master's programs in statistics.\n\nThe other subplan is in Data Science. Data Science involves being able to extract and clean (large volumes of) data from a variety of sources, analyze that data statistically, and help put the data analysis results in context for decision-making. Accordingly, the Data Science subplan requires fewer statistics electives than either the Applied Statistics Subplan or the Statistics BS but more computer science classes (needed for data wrangling) and more classes outside of Statistics to encourage and allow both big-picture thinking about data and domain specialization. Indeed, since Data Science involves domain specialization, this subplan includes a variety of \"emphasis\" options, which range from engineering to the social sciences, so students can choose to focus on building tools for automation or on specific domains of societal interest that are built on or benefit from careful data analysis.",

Students will learn analytical techniques that will be helpful in business settings, and that can prepare them for further study in a law school, an MBA program, or other graduate program.\n\nAmong the topics that students can explore through the minor are: the formation and regulation of business entities, the challenges of operating in a regulated market, rules applicable to fields in which many students will work (e.g., insurance, banking, consumer services, and manufacturing), and the intricacies of creating and managing intellectual property. Students who complete the minor will be in a better position to innovate; identify, define, and solve problems; and communicate effectively in interactions with lawyers as they navigate through regulatory requirements all businesses inevitably confront. The minor thus provides a portal to new ways of thinking and new forms of knowledge.\n\nRequired and elective courses in the minor are offered through the Carlson School of Management and the Law School. Transfer course substitutions may be considered for business designated courses (FINA, MGMT, BLAW). No substitutions will be made for LAW designated courses and no more than 2 courses may be transferred into the minor.\n\nAll advising is through the Undergraduate Program Office in the Carlson School of Management, room 2-190 Hanson Hall (lawminor@umn.edu; 612-624-3313).

Students explore the relationships among home, community, and school cultures for students of color, focusing on classroom contexts, but extending outside of school spaces to educational practices and insights of households and community organizations. Students partner with a school to produce critical digital media that address local issues of urban education. Students select additional core coursework in critical perspectives in education on either race, class, or language and in ethnic or gender studies classes. \n\nStudents who combine this minor with an undergraduate degree in liberal arts, sciences, or ethnic studies will position themselves to critically engage their communities on educational issues or for graduate work in secondary teacher licensure, educational policy, and other educational studies.",

The department also prioritizes local American Indian community engagement and advocacy. One of the single best ways to create positive change within our communities is to instill pride and celebrate cultural traditions like language at an early age. What distinguishes this program from any other is our communication-centered approach based in storytelling and Dakota lifeways and knowledge in addition to using both academically rigorous grammatical instruction and immersion techniques inside the classroom. This method has proven to be a very powerful combination in helping our students reach a high level of proficiency in the Dakota language. Students who complete the program to attain this high proficiency will have the foundational skills to contribute to Dakota language community building by bringing the Dakota language back into the home, to go into the high-demand field of immersion teaching, and to work in language preservation programs. With this major, students will: \n\n1) Be more prepared to fill an ever-growing need for immersion teacher positions; 2) Graduate with a more sophisticated knowledge of the Dakota language in general; 3) Graduate with the prestige that comes of having earned a bachelor's degree in the Dakota language; 4) Have more time to increase their fluency under instructor supervision; 5) Increase their knowledge of immersion pedagogy; and 6) Earn a bachelor's degree in the Dakota language (rather than a certificate) thereby increasing both their Dakota language credentials and earning potential upon graduation.",
