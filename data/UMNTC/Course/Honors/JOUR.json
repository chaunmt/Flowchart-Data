We?ll examine journalism, advertising, public relations, video gaming, music recording, music and more. We'll think about issues like free speech, fake news, censorship, social media, demographics, psychographics and graphic content. Hear from mass media professionals who provide real-world, real-time material for discussion and debate. This class covers ground that is shifting by the day and uses current cases to help you apply what you learn and sharpen your own media literacy skills. ",

Does that mean that journalists can write anything they want, broadcast any video images they choose, or go wherever they like in order to gather news? In this course, we will examine significant court decisions that have defined the legal rights and privileges of journalists. We will look at statutes like the Freedom of Information Act and journalist \"shield laws.\" We will consider how new technology raises questions, and challenges, about how to balance First Amendment freedoms with other interests, like privacy and national security. Learn legal rules and principles, and apply them in classroom debate and discussion and in written exercises and examinations. The goal is to understand how the First Amendment and other laws protect the rights of freedom of expression, not just for journalists, but for all of us.\n\nprereq: Honors",

    "info": "Are the news media doing a good job? How can you tell? Does it matter? Is The Daily Show the best news program on television? Why or why not? Most people seem to have an opinion about all of these questions. Most discussions seem to center on one of four themes: 1) who owns the media and what they care about; 2) whether the news media are becoming more or less credible and/or biased; 3) whether entertainment is replacing or enhancing information in news programming; and 4) how much, if at all, is the Internet changing everything about the way the media work, including who we think of as a journalist. Mass Media and U.S. Society explores the validity and importance of these themes in terms of what roles can the media play in society, what roles does it play, and how have those roles have changed over time. The course draws on ideas from various social sciences to develop tools for discussing a number of specific issues related to these themes. \n\nprereq: honors",
