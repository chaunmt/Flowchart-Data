Our goal will be to develop the skills of slow-motion, skeptical reading: to savor the crafting of literary form and to explore how literary rhetoric engages our intellect and emotions; to read not simply for superficial content, but to engage and question the multi-faceted operation of literary texts.\n\nIn terms of foundational writing skills for the English major, we will work on the development of compelling written literary arguments by breaking the writing process down into various phases.   We will work with the basics of argumentation: developing a strong, coherent thesis, drafting, the logic of argument, revision, proper citation and effective use of primary and secondary sources, and more. \n\nprereq: Honors, [English major or minor or approved BIS or IDIM program with English area]",

Our investigation will identify common traits in the literature that causes it to fit within three very broad literary historical categories: realism, modernism, and postmodernism. We will explore what makes literature created by the people of the United States distinctly \"American\" during a period that extends from the Civil War and the outlawing of slavery to women's suffrage, workers' movements, the Great Depression, the First and Second World Wars, and the civil rights movement. In addition to reading and analyzing the literature itself in terms of style, form, genre, and language, we will study it in historical context: the complex interplay between the political, the social, the cultural, and the literary in the United States. This approach rests upon the notion that literature is not created in a vacuum; it is influenced by and influences the world in which it is created.",

Students must discuss their plans with their instructor by the end of the second week of the term. Student and instructor must decide together what additional or enriched work will be required to have the capstone paper count as an honors thesis. Examples of such work include covering the topic in greater depth, using primary sources more robustly, or incorporating more creativity, more synthesis, and/or advanced analysis. Consult with your honors adviser for more details. \n\nThis course also functions as a capstone experience that fulfills many of the Student Learning Outcomes for the English major. In this rigorous and intensive seminar, students receive instruction on writing this paper from tenured and tenure-track faculty in English. Students learn how to choose a topic and formulate a research question, conduct primary and secondary research, and produce a written document that incorporates research and analysis. Faculty teach students to produce an extended, scholarly essay though discussions of method, research, and development; instruction in specific writing techniques; workshopping and revising drafts; solving problems; and creating a coherent and elegant final product. While the subjects about which students write vary depending on student interest and faculty expertise, at least 50% of the course grade is determined by students? writing performance. Most students fulfill the senior paper requirement with a traditional seminar paper, but students sometimes complete alternative projects, such as blogs, analytic projects that incorporate creative or personal elements, collaborative projects, or projects that involve the creation of a podcast, video, web site, or some other means of documenting student learning and writing skills. \n\nPrerequisites for Admission: Honors, Admission to ENGL 3885V also requires English major status and completion of a Critical Theories and Methods course (ENGL 3001W, ENGL 3002, ENGL 4003) or approved transfer course with a minimum grade of C-minus. Priority will be given to students with senior status who have completed the majority of the major requirements, as well as to students who plan to graduate in the term they are requesting to take the senior seminar.",
