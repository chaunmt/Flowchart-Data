    "info": "This course introduces you to contemporary perspectives on art through the lens of race, power, and justice. How has art allowed marginalized people to protest oppression, express joy and defiance, and serve as a cultural space for healing? In what ways does the symbolic, open-ended language of art allow artists to imagine otherwise, conjure different futures, and connect to ancestral pasts that co-mingle with present lived experiences? Course readings center BIPOC voices and focus on issues of representation, cultural appropriation, and decolonization. We look at the emergence of \u2018fine art,\u2019 a cultural category steeped in race, power, and the politics of exclusion; the history of the Black art movement and its commitment to political purpose in art; the challenges that arise from the insistence that the political align with the aesthetic. The course explores Indigenous organizing and resurgence as well as the politics of opacity and refusal. We will study socially engaged art forms, Afro- and indigenous futurisms, creative practices that explode distinctions between \u201ctraditional\u201d and \u201cmodern,\u201d art and craft, and engage with art as a field of cultural expression deeply involved in imagining and demanding social justice.\n\nprereq: Honors student",

    "info": "How do artists read and write theory? What roles can ideas play in the creative process? This honors course investigates practices and theories that inform the work of contemporary artists. Through a combination of readings, lectures, asynchronous discussions, writing assignments, and experiments in practice and prose, we will explore some significant questions that lie at the crossroads of ethics and aesthetics. We will also dig into our own practices as artists, writers, and thinkers to understand more fully how ethics and aesthetics intersect in what we do. Readings include texts by visual artists and poets, articles from art journals, as well as essays by art historians and critics of visual culture. This course utilizes writing and critical thinking to deepen each student's connection to contemporary art and to reflect on their own aesthetic experiences. As a writing intensive course, Critical Theories emphasizes writing as a multi-purpose tool for making sense of\u2014and with\u2014art.  \n\nWhile not required, it is recommended that students take ARTS 1001 prior to 3401V.\n\nprereq: Honors Student and Junior or Instructor Consent",

This is a self-motivated and self-directed class. It is expected that you will produce a substantial amount of work to show in this course. Your work is self-directed. Artwork created from assignments (in other classes) will not be critiqued. Each artist will have two one-hour critiques of their work over the course of the semester. Critiques may include members from the arts community such as local artists, MIA, Midway Contemporary Art, Walker Art Center, The Soap Factory and Franklin Artworks. Grades are based on critique participation, attendance and your artist presentation. This class culminates in the BFA Exhibition in the Nash Gallery. Throughout the semester, we will meet with Nash Gallery staff to develop this final show.",
