    "info": "Course for French and FRIT majors only, to be taken during the final semester. \n\nThis is the capstone experience of the major in French and Francophone or FRIT Studies. Building on your prior coursework, your linguistic expertise in French, and your analytical skills, it gives you the opportunity to do independent, original work on a topic of particular interest to you. \n\nThis project is designed to bridge two upper-division French courses: a 3-credit elective of your own choice in the areas of literature, culture, or linguistics (i.e., one of your required electives numbered 31xx-36xx) and the senior project course itself (4101W/V). The elective provides background in the general field of research, while French 4101W/V allows you to learn the basics of research and advanced academic writing while working with a faculty member and a group of peers involved in similar projects.\n\nprereq: French 3101W and at least three electives completed.",
