    "info": "This course is intended to introduce students to the expressed hopes of the American people for their government and to the institutions and processes that have been created and recreated to achieve these hopes. The course is designed to help students understand what liberal education is by engaging in the study of American politics as a fundamentally critical and creative enterprise, and by grappling with the most complex and challenging problems of political life, such as the sources of political equality and inequality, and the tension between individual aspirations and political control.  Questions of power and choice, opportunity and discrimination, freedom and restrictions on freedom are fundamental to the historical development of and current controversies within the American political system, and we will attend to all of these. \n\nWe will explore topics including the ideas underlying the nation\u2019s founding and its constitutional foundations; civil rights and civil liberties; the role of the United States in an increasingly globalized world; the structure and function of American political institutions; and the behavior of American citizens in the political process. \n\nIn addition, we will learn to think and communicate like political scientists.  We will read primary documents, such as the Federalist papers, engage with scholarly arguments about the way the American political system works, and critically evaluate critiques of the American political system that have been offered from a variety of perspectives. \n\nBy the end of the semester students should have a basic understanding of the structure and function of American government as well as an increased ability to critically reflect on the degree to which our institutions, processes, and citizens live up to the expectations placed on them.  Students will be able to identify, define, and solve problems and to locate and critically evaluate information.  Students will have mastered a body of knowledge and a mode of inquiry.  This course fulfills the liberal education requirements for the Social Sciences Core.\n",

The first part of the class covers how to formulate a theory (a possible answer to a question), specify testable hypotheses (what you would see if the theory is correct or incorrect), and set up a research design to test those hypotheses. In the second part of the class, we cover quantitative data analysis, beginning from preliminary statistical analysis to multivariate linear regression. There is no mathematical or statistical background required for this course. By the end of the class, students should be able to ask and answer political questions using quantitative data and fluently evaluate statistical analyses of political phenomena in the media and many academic articles. prereq: Honors student",

Along the way, they will advance their understanding of what constitutes political science research and how to conduct political science research.\n\nStudents will be graded on the basis of drafts of their annotated bibliography, literature review and research design, a class presentation of the \u201cfront half\u201d of their senior thesis, and class participation including short weekly assignments.  Students are expected to keep up with the reading and, most importantly, to begin to conduct their own independent research.\n\nprereq: Pol sci major, honors",
