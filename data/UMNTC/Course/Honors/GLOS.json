    "info": "This class introduces Global Studies students to some of the major disciplines and methods used to make knowledge about the social world.  The course first addresses fascinating philosophical questions, such as, how is knowledge a social product?  How are knowing and understanding different?  How might we think of ignorance, too, as something constructed?  We then turn from theory to practice, and to the question, how can we frame our questions, and enact our research in humble and ethically principled ways?  Students will respond to this task by designing collaborative research projects.  They will first identify and define a real world issue; they will review different disciplines' methods for defining and approaching the issue, and then they will jointly create a collaborative research design. The course will help Global Studies students understand the interdisciplinary nature of the Global Studies major, and it will help them begin to think about the goals, interests, and methods of their senior projects.\n\nPrereq: Honors.",

    "info": "This course provides an introductory overview of core theories and concepts that prepare students for successful completion of the Global Studies curriculum. In this half of the Global Studies core course sequence, students will investigate questions pertaining to how representations of the modern world in popular media and academic writing contribute to, reaffirm, and often challenge relations of inequality and division tied to such categories as ethnicity, gender, and race. Drawing on a wide range of interdisciplinary sources including magazines, novels, films, and digital media, these questions may include: How do cultural representations of the Global South reinforce European imperial and colonial projects? What role do mass-market magazines and newspapers have in constructing difference and producing stereotypes that justify imperialist attitudes? How does the development of technologies, from railroads to the internet, affect collective experiences of time and space? How is 'fake news' and intentional misrepresentation a threat to democracy and to the ecological security of the Earth? Students will meet twice a week for lecture and attend a weekly recitation section with assignments that include short writing exercises and/or weekly Canvas posts and a midterm and final examination. This course will show how the politics of representation and knowledge production relate to changing formations of power, while giving students the conceptual vocabulary and critical skills to prepare for subsequent Global Studies courses. \n\nPrereq: Honors soph, jr, or sr",

How did the nation-state become a dominant political unit in the West, and how do postcolonial African states challenge its structure? What is the relationship between the Western liberal tradition, secularity, and violence? What are the histories and internal dynamics of the capitalist economy?
