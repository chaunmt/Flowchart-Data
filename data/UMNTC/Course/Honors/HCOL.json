    "info": "This course provides a structured format and outside supervision to assist Honors students and their faculty advisors in drafting and editing the prose of the Honors thesis. Specifically, students are asked to regularly solicit their thesis advisor for specific kinds of feedback on draft writing samples, meet with the faculty member to go over this feedback, and then write up a plan for incorporating the feedback into subsequent drafts. HCOL3103V assumes that the bulk of the work devoted to developing a thesis topic, consulting secondary sources, collecting data, doing analysis, and producing creative output has already been completed. Hence, assignments in HCOL3103V prompt students and thesis advisors to meet regularly in service of crafting prose appropriate for their discipline and project. The final assignment comprises the submission of the completed thesis draft to the full thesis committee. [This is an optional course for students seeking a Writing Intensive requirement while completing their Honors Thesis. UHP students must still take the required thesis support coursework -- either HCOL 3101H, HCOL 3102H, or the required thesis course in their department. Students are encouraged to complete HCOL 3101H or their approved departmental thesis course prior to this course.]",
