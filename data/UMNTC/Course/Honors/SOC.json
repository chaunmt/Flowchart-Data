    "fullname": "Honors: Sociology of Sexualities",
    "info": "In this course we will examine social theories and sociological research on the topic of sexuality. We will explore the concept of sexuality as it intersects with race, gender, age, and class. This course is designed to give you a basic understanding of sociological implications of sexuality in the United States. This course is intended to help you develop your analytical and critical thinking skills. You will be asked to move beyond your own experience and perspectives to sociologically analyze and evaluate over-simplified explanations of past and contemporary issues as they appear in our course readings. \n\nAdditional special assignments will be discussed with honors participants who seek to earn honors credit toward the end of our first class session. Students will also be expected to meet as a group and individually with the professor four times during the course semester.\n \nExamples of additional requirements may include:\n\u00b7   Sign up and prepare 3-4 discussion questions in advance of at least one class session.\n\u00b7   Work with professor and TA on other small leadership tasks (class discussion, paper exchange, tour).\n\u00b7   Write two brief (1-page) reflection papers on current news, or a two-page critique of a class reading\n\u00b7   Attend a presentation, workshop, or seminar on a related topic for this class and write a 2 page maximum reflective paper.\n\u00b7   Interview a current Sociology graduate student and present briefly in class or write a reflective piece, not more than 2 pages in length, to be submitted to the Professor.\n\nprereq: Honors",

    "info": "This is the second course in the two-course Honors Capstone Experience. In Soc 4978V, students will complete their data collection and analysis while the focus of the seminar turns to scholarly writing, and particularly to drafting and refining arguments.  \n\nThe Department of Sociology does not make any initial distinction between Honors students who are seeking cum laude, magna cum laude, or summa cum laude levels of Latin Honors. Instead, our focus is on helping students to develop ambitious and high-quality original research papers of which they can be justifiably proud and which can serve as testaments to their abilities.\n\nThe Department of Sociologys approach is to support every Honors student as they plan and conduct summa-level work. The ultimate recommendation for level of latin honors is made by the committee at the time of the thesis defense. In addition to the Honors thesis requirements, the recommendation for summa-level honors is reserved for the papers that demonstrate the following criteria:\n\n- Tight integration between a clearly defined question or thesis and the research presented;\n- Ambitious original research design, with research completed on time and analyzed appropriately;\n- Integration of ongoing conversations in the research literature into the design and analysis of the data gathered;\n- Powerful and precise prose which weaves together evidence and argument and which is attentive to both the lessons and limits of the data.\n\nStudents will do an Oral Defense and participate in a panel presentation at the spring Sociological Research Institute (SRI). \n\nThe Sociology Department requires completion of Soc 4977V/4978V to graduate with Latin Honors. \n\nprereq: 1001/1011V, 3701, 3801, 3811, 4977V, and at least 12 upper-division SOC credits; Sociology honors major & department consent",
