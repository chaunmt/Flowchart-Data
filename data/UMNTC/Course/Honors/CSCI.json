Students will learn how to access, read and evaluate credible literature, develop a research problem and hypothesis, select an appropriate methodology, and how to write a short research proposal. Students will engage with departmental research faculty through research talks and will explore and apply for research programs that are available (e.g. URGO, McNair, DREU.) Students will know what research entails, how it is performed, and why it can enhance an undergraduate experience.",
