His research interests include abstract dynamical systems, classical mechanics, population ecology, and conceptual climate models.  He was a founding co-PI for the Mathematics and Climate Research Network, a national mathematics research group currently administered at the American Institute of Mathematics.\n\nEarth's climate is changing rapidly, creating a crisis for humanity. This course will investigate the changing climate from a quantitative perspective by investigating simple models, comparing them to data, and using them to understand possible future climates.\nQuestions to be studied include these: What determines Earth's surface temperature? What is the role of greenhouse gases, and why are they increasing so dramatically? What is the role of ocean circulation? When will the Arctic Ocean become ice free, and why does it matter? Knowledge of high school algebra will be assumed. We will use spreadsheets to study data and models, but no prior experience with spreadsheets is required.  We will introduce concepts from classical physics as needed, so no prior knowledge of physics is required. No background in climate science will be assumed. The main prerequisite is an eagerness to learn about Earth's climate and a willingness to investigate data.\nGrades will be based on homework, class participation, and class projects.  No exams.\nGroup work is encouraged but not required.  Lectures and discussions will be interspersed and combined.",

(1) To present the basic theory of linear algebra, including: solving systems of linear equations; determinants; the theory of Euclidean vector spaces and general vector spaces; eigenvalues and eigenvectors of matrices; inner products; diagonalization of quadratic forms; and linear transformations between vector spaces. (2) To introduce certain aspects of numerical linear algebra and computation. (3) To introduce applications of linear algebra to other domains such as data science. Objectives (2) and (3) will be taught with hands-on computer projects in a high-level programming language. \n\nPrerequisites: MATH 1272 or equivalent",

Students will develop the ability and inclination to understand and develop realistic solutions to issues of social, political, and economic justice. Examples of specific topics include: the Flint water crisis, sea level change in an island community, gerrymandering, and racial bias in policing.
