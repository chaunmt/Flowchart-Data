    "info": "Public health systems are facing an increasing number of challenges: the pressures of globalization, aging populations, and the increase in patient lawsuits, as well as the high costs of medical research and treatments. With these issues in mind, we must critically analyze the manner in which medical care is provided in different systems so that we can design and adapt systems that provide high quality, effective, and efficient health care. Changes made to health care systems are frequently based on economic and political considerations, and many countries are currently experiencing significant challenges in health care that depart from the way their health care has been financed and provided in the past.\n\nThis course will introduce students to the Spanish health care system and the context in which it is developing, studying the key changes that have taken place up to the present day. Based on a series of case studies, students will be able to compare the Spanish health care model with other models like those of the United States, the United Kingdom, France, Sweden, and/or developing nations.\n\nYou will compare health care systems and performance on a variety of topics including morbidity and mortality, disease ranking, health system cost, quality, and safety to name a few. You will also develop your critical evaluation skills to analyze the quality of the evidence used to support the policies and practice of health care. This will enable you to critically observe the role governmental and non-governmental organizations play with regard to health care and health status.\n\nThroughout the course, special attention will be paid to comparisons between Spain and the United States with a focus on identifying and understanding health disparities and how each country and their health system are addressing elimination of health disparities. Health disparities exist for a variety of reasons, and this course will help you understand what those factors are, and how each country is attempting to improve the social determinants that directly contribute to health disparities.",

At the same time, there is a component of policy-related and institutional communication with regards to advancing the healthcare system, which includes topics that are difficult to transmit to the citizen such as the system\u2019s short-term and long-term sustainability and equality within the system. \n\nComplementing the public European healthcare systems, private or civil organizations such as private health centers, the pharmaceutical industry, and patient and professional associations play an important role. Among the primary parties with which they interact to maintain functioning and protect their interests is the government administration. For this reason, their efforts in institutional relationships, reputation management, and communication with the society at large plays an important role in their daily workings and their place in the healthcare system. \n\nIn addition, all these organizations have an ongoing relationship with the media, both general media as well as those specialized in healthcare correspondence, and, at this time, are facing the same business model changes in the area of communication. Those changes are leading them to develop and expand in the realm of digital communication.",

At the same time, we will study the topic of health inequities, which consist of \u201chealth differences between different populations that are important, systematic, avoidable, and unjust\u201d (Whitehead, 1992).1 \n\nWe will learn about the ecological and sociological dimensions using models like Sustainable Development Goals or questioning supposedly universal constructs like the Human Development Index, while remembering to reflect on concrete social situations and the cultural setting in which they develop.\n\nThe concept of health will be approached from its widest and most holistic dimension to introduce the contribution of the social sciences, from a global perspective on health to more specific contexts, and the differentiation between disease, discomfort, and illness. We will debate on the importance of terms like health care systems, pluralism, and alternative therapies and, finally, we will be introduced to a socio-cultural perspective to help us rethink concepts like health, hygiene, or care.\n\nThe health care mechanism, the institutionalization of care, and the functioning of these institutions will be another focus of our attention, analyzing the characteristics of teamwork, leadership or the formation of stereotypes. In this sense, we will try to bring together a dual perspective which includes a reflection on society and patients, and the continual questioning of our function as professionals in the area of health care and research.\n\nIn a more practical sense, we will analyze perspectives on determinants of health in groups made vulnerable by their condition or stigmatization in a determined society (we will focus on the local situation but also extend the comparison and reflection to other places), also questioning the acceptance of terms which we hear often as health care professionals and in coordination with other disciplines such as \u201cdependency\u201d or \u201cnormality.\u201d\n\n\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\u2014\n1 Quotation translated from Spanish by translator.

    "info": "Bioethics was initially projected with very wide objectives. V.R. Potter understood it as a dialogue between scientists and humanists to preserve humanity from its self-destruction and promote quality of life. In his words, \u201cMankind is urgently in need of a new wisdom that will provide the \u2018knowledge of how to use knowledge\u2019 for man\u2019s survival and for improvement in the quality of life\u2026.I therefore propose the term bioethics in order to emphasize the two most important ingredients in achieving the new wisdom that is so desperately needed: biological knowledge and human values.\u201d The Encyclopedia of Bioethics, edited by Warren Reich in 1978, suggests the following definition of bioethics: \u201csystematic study of human conduct in the area of the life sciences and health care, insofar as this conduct is examined in the light of moral, values, and principles.\u201d\n\nThe complex, multi-disciplinary model of modern healthcare creates numerous ethical conflicts. When the values of all the actors are taken into account when making decisions, there is inevitably disparity of criteria. The conflicts generated are not merely technical; they are also ethical, because the values of the people or institutions involved can be in conflict. In these instances, it is important that the medical professional knows to consider technical issues (the medical facts) and the values at play (the preferences of those involved, principles, norms, etc.), in order to make a good decision. At present, bioethics is considered a practical or applied ethics (to biomedicine), that attempts to resolve ethical dilemmas present in biomedicine. There are various fields within bioethics. The most relevant are foundational bioethics (which deals with the philosophical foundations of bioethics), environmental bioethics, clinical bioethics, and the bioethics of research. Bioethical issues tend to be complex problems that extend beyond the limits of a sole profession, for which reason it is essential to consider the input of healthcare professionals, philosophers, lawyers, psychologists, social workers, sociologists, and any other profession involved in the most hot-button ethical issues relating to the life sciences.\n\nAll the fields mentioned have great relevance due to the importance and prevalence of the issues taken on by bioethics. There are a great number of publications that indicate how numerous professionals confront common, difficult-to-regulate bioethical dilemmas in the clinical sphere as well as the in the area of research or in relation to the environment, but the formation needed to tackle these problems is insufficient. In a significant number of these articles, it is concluded that it is necessary to improve the bioethical formation of future professionals to be able to better address these issues. For this reason, education in bioethics has become a priority both in the United States and in Europe, as well as the rest of the world, as these issues are not limited to a specific area, but rather are global.",

Through practical internship experiences as well as a literature search, critical reading, data charting, discussions, and written assignments, students will deepen their understanding of the host country\u2019s cultural and health context and critically examine their own worldview.\n\nThe course is guided by the Core Competencies for Entering Medical Students (CCEMS) endorsed by the Association of American Medical Colleges. These competencies fall into four categories: interpersonal, intrapersonal, thinking and reasoning, and Science. Students will focus on these competencies as they reflect, research, write, articulate, and interact at their internship placements. A strong comprehension of these skills along with the knowledge they provide is necessary to successfully interact in a health care setting; in particular, a cross-cultural health care scenario with people from diverse backgrounds.\n\nThe course is designed to guide and support students in their internship experience and to create a foundation for a successful professional career in the field of health care. In addition to gaining a cross-cultural comparative view on health care work, the topics and assignments will deepen students\u2019 insights about themselves, their professional expectations, and how to be successful in the health care workplace. Students are expected to make a valuable contribution to the internship site through the completion of major projects or tasks, as well as to understand the work dynamic of their Spanish health care setting, including hierarchy, communication, local management strategy, and differences between Spain and the US.",

With an introduction to modern history, students will analyze different economic, political, and cultural elements that influence society at large and the workplace in particular. In this course, students will discuss many topics involving Spanish society, including the changing role of women, the role of civil servants, immigration, and the solidity of the family structure. In addition, students will analyze potential intercultural communication problems that may arise during their internship, and they will discuss strategies for adapting to their work experience in order to take full advantage of it.",
