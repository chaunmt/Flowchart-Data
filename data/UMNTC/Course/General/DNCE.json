In exploring these intersections, the course will engage migration and displacement/dis-location as sociopolitical, economic, and spatial phenomena, particularly in relation to struggles defined around land and water, labor and livelihood, asylum/refugees, and terrorism/security. We will examine the nature of so-called ethnic (immigrant) practices and diaspora, as well as the binary of rural/urban in the context of the narrative and transmission, internal and external cultural exchange, political resistance, and \"multiculturalism.\" The course will also address the ways that ideas of global North and global South are claimed, defined, and contested in this process.",

Class time is evenly devoted to studio and seminar settings because reading about the politics of salsa can inform our dance practice, and dancing salsa can inform how we understand what we read. In the studio students will engage in movement activities that critically examine salsa through dance making and dance technique (such as partnering, rhythm, displacement, turns, awareness of other bodies, and improvisation). We will relate practices of salsa in the studio to the critical discussion of readings and movies in the seminar room. We will develop skills that will help us to closely analyze dancing bodies and the social meanings of salsa practices. Come prepared to read, write, dance, and discuss course topics.
