We live in creation and in living in this place we seek to see to its ongoing health. In this course we will explore prominent ideas and themes in Native creation stories, by reading stories and scholarly commentary on what creation means in Native philosophy. Our reading will lead us to think about what we are doing to creation in an environmental sense, and we will think about how Native stories offer other perspectives on how we may think about how we are treating creation. We will explore the themes/ideas from the readings with creative writing, reflecting on our own relationship with creation through poetry, fiction, and essay. Creation is powerfully good for all of us!",

Native Americans say it eats human flesh.\" Maybe you wondered what this monster is and what Native people think of it. Maybe you thought it strange that a film was using a creature from Native tradition to threaten non-Native characters. Maybe you thought using such a creature was a bit too similar to those old movies where \"savage\" Indians threaten pioneer families.\n\nIn this seminar, we explore what strange spirits like windigos, Sasquatch, or Star Beings (aliens) mean in Native and non-Native contexts. In Indigenous contexts, such stories carry knowledge about how to live ethically with the world. We will also examine texts by non-Natives that engage with the Native content of these stories, asking whether they engage with this content as knowledge or as entertainment. Our comparative examination raises important questions about the relation of colonialism to the appropriation of Native lands and cultural expressions.",

The readings for the workshop are submissions from the membership of the workshop (which will include participants who are not formally enrolled in the workshop). We read and consider two submissions per week (sometimes more if the submissions are shorter) that are pre-circulated to all participants via the workshop's listserv. Readings under consideration include research papers, dissertation chapters, article manuscripts, research proposals, conference papers, and other submissions that will benefit from intensive engagement with the members and will deepen the knowledge of all of the participants. Students will gain experience with the research, writing, and revision process as well as scholarly conversations about original research and writing. The overarching aim of the workshop is to develop research, writing, revision, and scholarly discussion skills as well as community-building in American Indian and Indigenous Studies and professionalization in an increasingly interdisciplinary and global field of study.",
