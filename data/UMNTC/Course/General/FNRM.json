This remotely sensed imagery, combined with other geospatial technologies, gives us an unparalleled ability to monitor our changing world, including identifying natural and anthropogenic environmental impacts such as deforestation and urbanization. Imagery also allows us to plan our land use to minimize or avoid those impacts. In this course, we will discuss how imagery and geospatial data are being used to solve environmental problems, experience imaging data applied to actual environmental issues, learn about the imaging sensors used to acquire these data, and study related applications of remote sensing. We will explore imagery from satellites such as NASA's Landsat, high-resolution commercial sensors (as seen in Google Earth), aircraft-based imaging and lidar sensors, drones, and non-Earth remote sensing. We will discuss the future of the remote sensing of the environment in light of new and emerging imaging technologies.\n\nSince this is a Freshman Seminar that is focused on new college students, each class period will begin with a \u201cCollege Pro Tip\u201d that will cover an important skill, piece of information, or resource that will help you succeed at the University of Minnesota. These will generally take 10-15 minutes, after which we will cover the geospatial topic of the day. See the Class Schedule at the end of this syllabus for more information.\nprereq: freshman",

    "info": "This course is intended to be taken with, or after, the introductory remote sensing class, FNRM 3262/5262. It builds on the introductory course by providing a field context to the remote sensing discipline. We will focus on field methods and associated analyses that are typical in using and applying imagery and other spatial data. We will use a variety of remote sensing imagery, maps, field data collection tools, and software. Students will learn in an active, hands-on, way through multiple small-group field exercises. This course includes two eight-hour weekend field sessions.\n\nPrerequisite: grad student",
