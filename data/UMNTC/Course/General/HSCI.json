You will need no more than some basic high-school algebra and geometry. We begin by studying the special theory of relativity (1905) and some of its famous predictions such as time dilation, the twin paradox, and E=mc2. While working our way through this material, we will also look at elements of nineteenth-century physics that played a role in the development of special relativity. We continue to pursue a historical approach when we turn to the general theory of relativity (1915), the theory that makes gravity part of (curved) space-time. We trace the development of this theory from 1907 till about 1920. Einstein worked intensively on this theory living in Berlin during the first World War (1914-1918). For this period, we shall also take a close look at Einstein's personal life and at his tentative first appearances on the political stage. Finally, we cover Einstein's role in the development of quantum physics, both his early pioneering efforts in this field and his later opposition to quantum mechanics as formulated in the mid-20s. By the end of the course you should have a good understanding of some of Einstein's most revolutionary ideas, of how he arrived at them, at what personal price, and in what broader socio-political and cultural context.",

Human societies have long been embedded in physical landscapes where they are subject to specific environmental conditions and physical risks: eight thousand-year-old wall paintings in Turkey depict the eruption of Hasan Dag volcano over the city of Catal Huyuk, for example. But then and now, it takes a certain combination of social conditions and environmental events to create a natural disaster. In this course, we will use historical natural disasters to explore the interconnections between the structures and ideas of human society and environmental forces. Humans have not been simply the random victims of natural disasters; where and how they chose to live influenced the impact of any disastrous event. Examining these events in a historical context will help us see the social, technological, scientific, and environmental systems that have been constantly interacting, but which are normally taken for granted until they break down.",

    "info": "Earthquakes, hurricanes, tsunamis, wildfires, epidemic disease, and technological failures. This course will examine large scale natural events in American and world history, the social, technological, and environmental conditions that underlie them, and their historical consequences. Human societies have long been embedded in physical landscapes where they are subject to specific environmental conditions and physical risks: eight thousand-year-old wall paintings in Turkey depict the eruption of Hasan Dag volcano over the city of Catal Huyuk, for example. But then and now, it takes a certain combination of social conditions and environmental events to create a natural disaster. In this course, we will use historical natural disasters to explore the interconnections between the structures and ideas of human society and environmental forces. Humans have not been simply the random victims of natural disasters; where and how they chose to live influenced the impact of any disastrous event. Examining these events in a historical context will help us see the social, technological, scientific, and environmental systems that have been constantly interacting, but which are normally taken for granted until they break down.",

    "info": "The British colonies of North America were founded in precisely the same centuries as a revolution in European\u0092s understanding of nature, transformed by the ideas of Galileo, Newton, and Linnaeus and by the technologies of the industrial revolution. Native Americans and African Americans had their own knowledge of nature, and their close understanding intersected with the increasingly scientific techniques brought with European settlers and enhanced the survival and intellectual capacities of the newcomers. By demonstrating the diversity of scientists in the ever changing demographics of an immigrant nation, the course argues that this diversity and the capacities of newcomers contributed to the national success in science and engineering. The engagement with science at points were used to try to limit access by women or African-Americans, but sciences was also used to discredit false theories through ever expanding emphasis on empiricism as well as attention to the social and economic consequences of innovation. The goal is to demonstrate those historical linkages in particular places and institutions as they influenced and reinforced specific scientific work, while, at the same time, being attentive to how scientific ideas and practices were shaped by American culture.",
