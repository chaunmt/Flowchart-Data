    "info": "This class is about bioelectronics and the synergy between electronics and biomedical applications. It discusses how to architect robust ultra-low-power electronics with applications in implantable, noninvasive, wireless, sensing, and stimulating biomedical systems. Half of the classes span feedback systems, transistor device physics, noise, and circuit-analysis techniques to provide a circuit-foundation. The other half are research papers that describe the utilization of these circuits in implantable and wearable systems. Some of these systems include cochlear implants for the deaf, brain implants for the blind and paralyzed, cardiac devices for noninvasive medical monitoring, and biomolecular sensing systems. Prerequisites: BMEn 5101 or equivalent background in bioinstrumentation and electric circuits.",

Active adaptability of biological materials can significantly complicate measurement of their mechanical behavior. This course will cover fundamental continuum approaches for determining the complex stress states of actively responsive tissues as well as the force-feedback relationships that drive early development and allow mature tissues to maintain mechanical equilibrium.\n \nTopics will include theoretical approaches for active force generation, soft tissue finite growth, extracellular matrix remodeling, and constrained mixtures.\n\nThese methods are applicable to a wide range of biomechanical systems. In this course, they will be applied to mechanics of two model systems: arterial growth and remodeling in hypertension and sheet folding in early organogenesis and morphogenesis.\n\n\nprereq: 3011 or AEM 2021 or equiv",
