Crises can be broadcast around the world in minutes via social media, creating negative headlines for months. In addition, complex, world-wide problems like climate change, religious fundamentalism, cyber security, health care, population growth, urbanization, and terrorism require effective communications to lessen the consequences of a crisis on an organization's activities, reputation, and stakeholders. We will examine a variety of current international and national case studies to examine what went wrong and consider how businesses can better prepare for, prevent, and respond to global crises.",

You will focus on understanding personal leadership strengths and vulnerabilities through assessments, reflection, and feedback. To improve your leadership capabilities, you must know from what point you are starting. Throughout the class, there will be reflection exercises and assessments that will help you understand your values, default traits, and work styles as you navigate everyday moments of leadership.\n\nLeadership skills are best learned by integrating and applying evidence-based theoretical concepts to practical situations.
