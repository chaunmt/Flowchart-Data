The course begins with an overview of differences between ethnic studies and area studies, levels of multicultural curriculum, and the significance of Chicana/o/x studies. It explores the major theories that have informed analysis and methods: experiential knowledge, cultural nationalism, internal colonialism, hegemony and counter-hegemony, coloniality of power, transnationalism, globalization, Chicana feminisms, intersectionality, oppositional consciousness, heteropatriarchy, abjection, racialization, anti-Black racism and Afro-Latinx studies, structural analysis, and queer theory, decolonial methods, Critical Race Theory, and Critical Latinx Indigeneities.

Students will investigate institutional and social constraints on equitable educational opportunities for Chicano/Latino students by exploring models for decolonizing education through civic action.\n\nTo fulfill the service-learning component of this course, (outside of class time) students will tutor and mentor Chicanos/Latinos at El Colegio or Academia Cesar Chavez as well as dialogue with Chicano/Latino educators and advocates. Generally, students will work 2-3 hours per week with one of these two partners. In this way, \u201cservice-learning\u201d means that the course is experiential, using discussion and hands-on activities to deliver course material and achieve student learning outcomes. Education takes place in multiple social settings, particularly in the community, and thus, outside of the classroom. ",

By engaging with scholarship on media representation, students learn to identify the major stereotypes of Latinos in television, film, and news media.

    "info": "There are few things more basic and bonding between humans than making and sharing food together. To offer food and drink is a gesture of hospitality throughout the world. When we cook and eat, we can traverse our family\u2019s generations and migrations through and across regional and national boundaries. By understanding the practices surrounding someone\u2019s food, we can come to understand a great deal about their culture. Indeed, food is often a site of cultural fusion and hybridity, indicating the human ability to share, adapt, and change. Food, cooking, eating, and the rituals surrounding them reflect and are informed by ethnicity, race, gender, sexuality, nationality, migration, and class. For these reasons, food is an excellent topic through which to explore intersectionality, empowerment, and cultural memory\u2014three major topics in Chicana/o and Latinx studies. \n\nThis course is a study of food as an integral part of human experience, but particularly the experiences with food across latinidades, social groups of Latin America living in the United States. We study food as a form of cultural expression but also as a mechanism of power and inequality. As such, we examine topics such as the food service industry, farm worker organizing, food insecurity, cultural appropriation, and agri-business and food production). Each of these topics focus our attention on inequality and injustices, such as racism, sexism, hunger, and other difficult subjects. However, these topics also reveal resistance and agency among Latinos and Latinas, as well as Latinx people, the gender neutral term intended to include the wide range of gender identities among people of Latin American heritage living in the U.S. By understanding the labor and politics of the food industry, uneven access to food, and society\u2019s expectations about Latinx cuisines, we come to understand the structural forces that generate notions of race, gender, sexuality, nationality, human migration, and material inequity. Through our sharing of food, recipes, and the stories behind them, particularly the foods prepared for d\u00edas de los muertos (trans: days of the dead) we will gain understanding of our diverse experiences, looking at our past as well as our present, and the memories and structural conditions that shape our experiences. To deepen our knowledge, we learn from and engage with Latinx urban farmers and come to appreciate the Indigenous Mexican cultural values for the environment and sustainability.",

    "info": "This course seeks to act as a site in which open honest dialogue can take place regarding our shared stake in a multiracial society. This course will study race and ethnicity in order to rethink foundational ideas, histories, and movements in United States society and beyond.  An overriding theme of the course will be an examination of how power relations are constructed through racism and its tie to colonialism; and conversely, how racialized communities--particularly African American, Latin@/e, Asian American, and American Indian--are sites of survival and resistance. Therefore, a guiding question that we will explore and discuss collectively will be what role has/does race play in re-creating unequal and hierarchical social arrangements in U.S. society?Understanding that the practice of race is not a series of isolated events, but an institutional phenomenon that works on a societal level, we will ask further, what purposes has/is race used for? To what ends has race been applied to ascertain who has access to resources, who works where, and who is a legitimate member of U.S. society?Indeed, a number of scholars agree that race has been and continues to be used to maintain or reconstruct an unequal society, for the benefit of particular interests, in the form of systematic oppression, but Ethnic Studies scholars have also ascertained that Black, Indigenous, and brown communities have also responded to racial oppression in a myriad of ways and a diversity of peoples have challenged institutional and everyday racism.  In light of this we will also ask, how have colonized people and their allies challenged, resisted, and accommodated racial oppression in U.S. society?In particular, the class will close out considering the movement for Ethnic Studies in the K-12 school system across the U.S. and the ways in which it does not only seek to add new voices and perspectives, but to rethink the approach to education generally as a transformative process. All in all, this course will analyze race and ethnicity to question and collectively address the limits and possibilities of a democratic society and seek to propose alternative practices that might make our society more democratic and egalitarian. Indeed, another emphasis of this course in regards to the larger inquire of democratic practice will be how racial and ethnic identities and social forces intersect with other categories such as class, gender, sexuality, and nationality. In these ways it is in the hope that students use these themes as a window into thinking critically about our society so that we might determine our own position in order to contribute to on-going struggles for a better world.",

From its inception, the Chicano Movement attracted artists who created a new aesthetic and framework for producing art, but they did not merely illustrate the social and civil rights movement by creating posters and flyers. Artists theorized, negotiated, proposed, and initiated new ethics, aesthetics, and ways of thinking that supported self-determination, hope, social critique, solidarity, and justice. Increasingly since the 1980s, Chicanas and Chicanx artists renegotiated this social justice contract. Chicana/o/x art continues to inform Mexican American cultural production and the nation\u2019s cultural heritage.

Chicano, Chicana, and Chicanx identities crystalized during the Chicano Movement (1965-1980), which witnessed the rise of collective mobilizations to improve the labor conditions, education, housing, health, and civil rights for Mexican Americans. From its inception, the Chicano Movement attracted artists who created a new aesthetic and framework for producing art, but they did not merely illustrate the social and civil rights movement by creating posters and flyers. Artists theorized, negotiated, proposed, and initiated new ethics, aesthetics, and ways of thinking that supported self-determination, hope, social critique, solidarity, and justice. Increasingly since the 1980s, Chicanas and Chicanx artists renegotiated this social justice contract. Chicana/o/x art continues to inform Mexican American cultural production and the nation\u2019s cultural heritage. Social intervention, empowerment, and institutional critique remain some of the most important innovations of American artists, Chicana/o/x artists among them.",
