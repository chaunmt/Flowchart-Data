The course will include sessions on technique, brushwork, color theory and the use of different media. During the first half of the course, assignments will concentrate on developing different skills and building techniques, using traditional and experimental approaches to painting. During the second half of the course, students will use these skills to develop their own work.\nStudents will explore the history of art in Florence in the many galleries and museums and will use this knowledge to inform their own work. The course will cover the technical developments of the Renaissance, including the study of perspective, line, and form. Through guided instructional sessions, students will gradually cultivate their unique artistic styles and engage in individual research, which may involve integrating themes and techniques from both modern and contemporary art. This study will be the basis for developing painting skills through engaging with, and responding to, the works and artists they study.\nThe course will also have a focus on developing skills for self and peer criticism to discuss the development of the work. Students will create a final piece supported by an Artist's Statement, a research breakdown outlining the evolution of the project's concept and technical development.",

Moreover, it was the place where different cultures met: This course will explore their reciprocal influence, with a special focus on art history and a mainly Italian and Florentine point of view. Topics will include: the impact of Islamic art on Western culture; the role of Byzantine art in the development of Florentine painting; the rediscovery of Greek classical culture and its importance in Renaissance civilization; the consequences of the fall of Constantinople and of the expansion of the Ottoman Empire. Students will explore Florentine churches, palaces, and museums in search of visual evidence of the links between the city and the diversity of Mediterranean culture.",

Just as each of us influences the group and its members, so, too, do groups shape each one of us. The ethical principles of societies have been developed through group processes, and ethics play a crucial role in the contemporary world.\nUsing the lenses of social identity theory and community psychology, this course invites students to reflect critically on the ethical implications of what has and continues to constitute Italian-ness in light of new identities emerging in Italian society. We will do so by addressing \u201cminority identities\u201d in Italian society, starting with an overview of Italy\u2019s colonial past and racial history up to the contemporary challenges that a multicultural Italy faces today. \n\nWhile learning about new Italian identities, we will discuss and reflect on the basic theories of community psychology (diversity, oppression and power, empowerment, being an agent of change, etc.), discussing the role that concepts such as gender, race, nation, culture, value/s, diversity, otherness, and intersectionality play in contemporary Italy. More specific topics, studied in the Florentine context, include the following:\n- Migrants in Italy: a \u201crecent\u201d phenomenon. We will talk about acculturation strategies, different cultural backgrounds, and the emerging of new identities.\n- History and actuality of LGBT+ people living in Italy. We will conduct an overview of the evolution of Italian culture and of the legislation concerning LGBT people, health services, and activism. \n- Women in Italy, between stereotypes and modernity. We will discuss how in many aspects of everyday life women still remain prisoners of stereotypes, despite major progress made in legislation and education.\n\nThis course aims to prepare students to become active and responsible citizens within their local, national, and world communities, encouraging them to develop, defend, or challenge their personal values and beliefs. To this purpose, they will engage in a series of conversations with local stakeholders in minority representation in Italy.",

The course will explore its core ideas integrating theoretical and experiential-learning approaches.\n\nStarting from the fundamentals of communication theory, with a focus on listening skills and effective storytelling, students will draw from case studies to understand the underlying core of communication activities in fashion and the arts. The promotional process in both industries will be analyzed in its main parts (research, planning, execution, evaluation), as well as in its ethical and legal implications.\n\nStudents will experiment with promotional tools to understand the connection between public relations and the media, and explore the blurred line between public relations and marketing when dealing with social media contents and strategic planning.

Study of the different diets of the Byzantines and the Venetian merchants, and the influence of the spice trade and nascent Islam during the Middle Ages, will show how identities are formed, consolidated, and changed through food. The Renaissance, especially in Florence, will be the object of an in-depth analysis as a pivotal time in Western food culture and in the arts. The course will then investigate the relationship between Florentine and French elite identities via the birth of modern table manners (and dishes) and their connection with the rise of the first nation states. The last part of the course will consider modern states, migration, and how these interconnect with agricultural practices and industrial food processes that have changed the nature of food production in the Mediterranean.",

Barthes, Roland Barthes by Roland Barthes, trans. R. Howard, McMillan, London 1977)\n\nTravel experience in Italy has been for centuries an inspirational path for writers, novelists, and journalists from all over the world. The deep history and the most significant places in this relevant European country\u2014connected both to the Northern cultures and at the crossroads with the Mediterranean ones\u2014has prompted new narrative strategies, peculiar fictional characters, and innovative plots. Authors have been travelling the country by different means of transportation\u2014carriages, trains, but also on foot\u2014that have influenced their perspectives. They have walked into churches, squares, gardens, and museums to explore a flourishing collection of symbols and values from the past and to foresee the complexity of the future of Western civilization. They have tasted delicious and repellent flavors in Italian markets, shops, and restaurants and discussed Italian society and its issues. They have changed their personal mindsets, exploring new maps of their own cultural identity.\n\nTraveling abroad has always been, in fact, an experience of enrichment, enhancement, and transformation of a traveler\u2019s identity and intimate self. Starting from this assumption, this creative writing course will use the narrative strategies offered by modern and contemporary autobiography to draw inspiration from the students\u2019 Italian and European travel experience. At the same time, a \u201cclassic\u201d field in literature and a flourishing contemporary trend, the genre of autobiography defies categories. It allows us to experiment with innovative forms\u2014from diary to travelogue, from literary nonfiction to the so-called \u201cautofiction\u201d\u2014that are also currently evolving under the influence of the social networks and the possibilities of augmented experience offered by the Web.",

    "info": "This studio course for intermediate students builds on foundational painting techniques and focuses on refining artistic expression and technical proficiency. Students will explore advanced composition strategies, deepen their observational skills, and experiment with sophisticated color theory applications to enhance their creative works. During the first half of the course assignments will concentrate on developing different skills and building techniques, using traditional and experimental approaches to painting. During the second half of the course students will use these skills to develop their own work.\nStudents will explore the history of art in Florence in the many galleries and museums and will use this knowledge to inform their own work. The course will cover the technical developments of the Renaissance, including the study of perspective, line, and form. Through guided instructional sessions, students will gradually cultivate their unique artistic styles and engage in individual research, which may involve integrating themes and techniques from both modern and contemporary art. This study will be the basis for developing painting skills through engaging with, and responding to, the works and artists they study.\nThe course will also have a focus on developing skills for self and peer criticism to discuss the development of the work. Students will create a final piece supported by an Artist's Statement, a research breakdown outlining the evolution of the project's concept and technical development.",
