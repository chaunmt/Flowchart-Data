How do they fit into the U.S.'s history of immigration, race, and citizenship? Is the \"model minority\" myth really true? This course is an introduction to Asian American Studies, an interdisciplinary field that uses ethnography, literature, histories, films, memoirs, and other texts to study how the history of Asian immigration to the United States has visibly shaped existing Asian American communities and identities, and how \"Asian America\" is central to a more general understanding of American popular culture and public life.\n\nThe course is roughly organized chronologically. We will first begin with an introduction to the field of Asian American Studies by asking the questions: What is Asian America? What is Asian American Studies? We will then examine important concepts, categories, and processes before exploring the rich history of Asian migration to the United States and contemporary issues facing Asian Americans today.\n\nOne of the core principles of this course is to encourage active and interdisciplinary learning. This means that we will be learning in a variety of ways to explore and understand the material (reading, writing, watching, listening, seeing, discussing, presenting). We will be drawing from a wide range of disciplines (history, law, sociology, education, cultural studies, psychology, etc.). And we will be using a variety of materials (memoir, scholarly articles, historical documents, government records, newspapers, films, photographs, popular culture, etc.) Your active participation in these activities is essential.",

Food is the medium through which Asian American cultural difference, their status as \"perpetual foreigners,\" and the \"model minority character\" are typically expressed and disseminated. Historically, Asian migration to the United States was fueled by labor needs, particularly in the agricultural sector. In addition, Asian labor has been stereotypically linked to food service and preparation such as the ubiquitous Chinese take-out place and more recently, the sushi and Korean fusion joints.\n \nThis course is an introduction to the interdisciplinary study of food as a way to understand the historical, social, and cultural aspects of Asian American food preparation, distribution, and consumption. Students will investigate the politics and poetics of Asian American food ways by examining social habits and rituals around food in homes, restaurants, and other public venues. Texts include ethnographic essays, fictional works, memoirs, magazines, visual arts, and television shows.",

On the one hand, baseball provides a means through which the American dream has often been viewed and has itself been viewed as an idyllic representation of that dream and all that is good about American culture. But on the other hand, throughout history baseball has also reflected many of the struggles seen in the broader society. Whether it be racism, the realities of war, the place of women, the labor movement and unionization, or any of a number of other issues, baseball has provided a view into societal issues - sometimes leading the way and shining a spotlight on the issues and sometimes lagging behind other parts of society in dealing with the issues.

Yet, employers in this time period were alternately uncertain, reluctant, or downright resistant to implementing these new antidiscrimination laws. Put another way, the change in law did not automatically result in more people of color and white women being hired or put an end to discrimination. Between 1964 and 1981, the impetus for change came from social movements such as the civil rights movement and the women\u2019s liberation movement as they worked with or inspired unions, caucuses, and associations to push for the enforcement of federal law, thereby opening up American workplaces to people of color and white women.  To understand how activists transformed American workplaces, this course begins by focusing on the social movements of the 1960s and 1970s and their political ideals and strategies. The remainder of the course will focus on how unions, caucuses, and associations in a variety of workplaces drew from these social movements in their pursuit of racial and/or gender equality.  Not only will the course explore how these different campaigns faired, but it will also consider the questions they raise for racial and gender workplace justice in the contemporary moment.",

    "info": "Asian Americans have always been intimately connected to food practices and institutions in the American imagination. Food is the medium through which Asian American cultural difference, their status as \"perpetual foreigners\" and the \"model minority character\" are typically expressed and disseminated. Historically, Asian migration to the United States was fueled by labor needs particularly in the agricultural sector. In addition, Asian labor has been stereotypically linked to food service and preparation such as the ubiquitous Chinese take-out place and more recently, the sushi and Korean fusion joints. This course is an introduction to the interdisciplinary study of food to better understand the historical, social, and cultural aspects of Asian American food preparation, distribution and consumption. Students will investigate the politics and poetics of Asian American foodways by examining social habits, and rituals around food in restaurants, homes and other public venues. The course texts include ethnographic essays, fictional works, memoirs, magazines, and television shows.",

We will approach the categories of both \u201cAsian American\u201d and \u201cwomen\u201d less as static identities and more as shifting political coalitions that bring together diverse groups of people whose experience of gender, sexuality, race, and class deviates from the norm of white, heterosexual, and cisgender American citizenship. In tracking (and at times celebrating) these deviations, we will ask: how might film, TV, literature, art, and theory help illuminate Asian American feminist politics?",

Drawing on political organizing by women of color during the recent Black Lives Matter uprising, we consider what it means to make and claim space as women of color in politics.  We also look at how rage - BIPOC women's rage, white rage, rage against women - gets mobilized to cement and/or combat racism, xenophobia, and misogyny.  Finally, the course reframes women's rage as intrepid and redemptive, capable of sparking change during this political movement.",
