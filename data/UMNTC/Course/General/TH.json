Theatrical performance reflects, resists, and rewrites culture; it can (and does) perform the political by reimagining and transforming society. Through exciting examples of plays and productions from around the world, we investigate the history, politics, and aesthetics of theatre. We explore how the different components of theatre (from directing to acting, costume, and lighting design) come together to create powerful impact on stage. We read and discuss plays in class, see performances on stage, and hear from some of the Twin Cities\u2019s most dynamic and committed artists. And we work on valuable writing skills that help us to deepen our understanding of theatre and communicate our insights to others. At the end of the class, we bring together everything we have been learning to make theatre in small groups. \n\nNo previous theatre experience is needed.",

We discuss how we \u201cperform ourselves\u201d through media, giving rise to social anxieties about truth, authenticity, equality, and belonging, but also to tremendous opportunities for self-expression and connection. And we investigate how our performances are monetized or instrumentalized by governments, social movements, or corporations. How did our current media system develop, and whose interests has it served? How, for better or worse, has the social media age changed us and the world we live in? And how can we make sure that in the future that change is for the better?",

While participating in modernizing projects, avant-garde artists maintained independence from state institutions and voiced criticism of dictators. This course examines avant-garde performance in several locations of the Global South, analyzing dramas of national history, modernist music, activist theater, cosmopolitan dance, transnational cultural circuits, and politically radical performances. \n\nReading historical, social, and performance studies, we will develop methods for analyzing performances that aim to make transformative social interventions. These include textual analysis, ethnography, performance analysis, and tracking transnational cultural exchange. You will apply select methods in your final research paper, which centers on an avant-gardist cultural phenomenon in the contemporary Global South.",

The classwork will invite you to explore many aspects of the craft of directing, including the following:\n\n\u00b7\tDefining the role of the director: responsibility and relationships to playwright/actors/audience.\n\u00b7\tHow to think and conceptualize like a director.  \n\u00b7\tWhat is blocking? How does it work? Who creates it?  Staging actions and events.\n\u00b7\tUnderstanding the building blocks of life on stage through composition and scene work.\n\u00b7\tAnalysis of dramatic text from the director\u2019s point of view (and expressing it in writing).\n\u00b7\tPreparation in the role of the director \u2013 historical/textual/visual research.\n\u00b7\tRehearsing and working with actors  - What makes a good rehearsal?

The course will be a 3-week long study abroad course with pre-departure readings and films, on-site readings and activities, and a final project due upon return.\nAustralia is an isolated place considered to be on the \"edge of the world,\" simultaneously the oldest continent and a young civil society. It is a place evocative of wild stunning landscape, exotic wildlife, and a history as a convict colony. Since the birth of the Australian film industry in the 1950's Australian filmmakers have sought to tell their own stories and to interrogate the idea of Australian culture. The global success of films such as Mad Max, Crocodile Dundee, and Priscilla Queen of the Desert have served to reinforce and disrupt stereotypes of Australia as a place and culture. In contrast, films such as Rabbit Proof Fence, Animal Kingdom and The Sapphires seek to tell alternative narratives. Themes such as the urban and rural divide, conquering nature, the place in society of indigenous communities, and fatalism are interrogated\nSimilarly, Australian writers such as Colleen McCullugh, Kate Grenville, Tim Winton, and Liane Morriarty have gained international readership. Their novels, as well as others, use landscape and storytelling to create and challenge simplistic ideas of Australian history and culture.\nBy studying the history and works engaged in creating and interpreting this idea of Australian identity, from Australian artists, students will be asked to engage in a more complex way with the ideas of heritage, culture, and national identity in general. Students will also read selected essays on Australian history and culture. The IDI (Intercultural Development Inventory) will also be used as a tool to engage with the dialogue on identity and culture in general.",

In postcolonial Africa and Asia, where arts were linked to national modernization projects, artists have played a key role in shaping citizens? identity, alongside schools and universities. While participating in modernizing projects, avant-garde artists maintained independence from state institutions and voiced criticism of dictators. This course examines avant-garde performance in several locations of the Global South, analyzing dramas of national history, modernist music, activist theater, cosmopolitan dance, transnational cultural circuits, and politically radical performances.\n\nReading historical, social, and performance studies, we will develop methods for analyzing performances that aim to make transformative social interventions. These include textual analysis, ethnography, performance analysis, and tracking transnational cultural exchange. You will apply select methods in your final research paper, which centers on an avant-gardist cultural phenomenon in the contemporary Global South.",

Critical literacy is the focus; theater and storytelling are the vehicles. Key topics to be covered include: 1) A historical background on fairy and folk tales, legends, fables, myths, and the different oral traditions; 2) Tools for developing a critical view of diverse tales; 3) Practical instruction on how to use storytelling and story genres in the classroom to develop critical literacy; and 4) Assessing storytelling work in the classroom. Students will meet in the first week at the University to learn tools of the Neighborhood Bridges program and in the second week will practice and observe each other's teaching with local school classrooms. In the past we have worked with 4th graders and 6th graders, though we will also discuss how course content applies to high school students. The class meets for two intensive weeks in person, however, we additionally assign pre-readings and post-class reflections and papers.",
