The course grade is primarily based on these three projects in lieu of a final exam. \n\nLectures and discussion topics throughout the semester include: \n-skills and strategies for writing patent applications, \n-appeal practice including brief writing before the Patent Trial and Appeals Board (PTAB) at the US Patent Office, \n-clearance analysis including invalidity and non-infringement counseling and opinions, \n-foreign practice including national filings in foreign countries and international filings using the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), including leveraging patent prosecution highways for accelerated examination, \n-eligible subject matter issues including recent case law and claim drafting tips, \n-accelerated examination procedures within the US Patent and Trademark Office,\n-legal and practical considerations of infringement counseling including formulating invalidity and non-infringement opinions, \n-post grant review and other mechanisms for challenging issued patents before the US Patent and Trademark Office, \n-patent prosecution related considerations that arise in relation to participation in industry standards organizations,\n-patent prosecution related considerations that arise in the context of universities and technology licensing organizations, and \n-design patents.\n\nprereq: Master of Science Patent Law Students only.",

We will explore the art of innovation and the integral role that patents play in turning an idea into an innovation. Goals: Students will learn how to research complex subject matter across the intersecting domains of business, finance, marketing, science, technology, and intellectual property. Students will then develop the ability to present their findings in a clear and concise manner that is understandable to and can be acted upon by a cross-functional audience of high-level decision makers.",

We will explore the sources of state-based trade secret law, the common law and statutes, and seek an understanding of relevant federal law and the interplay of state and federal law.

State trial court placements are with judges handling criminal, civil, family, or juvenile court matters and with problem-solving courts (e.g., drug court). Externships may also be available at the Office of Administrative Hearings and with the federal Immigration Court. Separate application to those courts is required; watch for notice about placement possibilities through the Career Office. \n\nFederal court placements (Federal District Court, Federal Magistrate-Judges, and Federal Court of Appeals) are made using an application process that occurs a few months before the start of the term.  Notification will be sent to all students about deadlines for applying. For the rest of the placements, students registered for the class will be asked to complete a form specifying their preferences and to submit a resume, transcript, and cover letter to be used in the placement process. Students will be assigned based on their requests and the judges\u2019 needs. After placement, each student arranges a work schedule with the assigned judge and his or her staff.  Students are encouraged to arrange their class schedules to have several large blocks of time available for fieldwork; free mornings are especially important for attending court hearings.\n\nFieldwork in chambers generally includes both substantive assignments in research and writing and observation of court proceedings. Substantive assignments will depend upon the nature of the court\u2019s calendar and may include such work as preparing a memorandum or proposed order and decision on a summary judgment motion, summarizing and evaluating deposition testimony, or researching substantive legal issues raised in a motion, trial, or appeal. Students may observe a variety of proceedings, ranging from settlement conferences to motions hearings to trials to appellate arguments. They may be proceedings conducted in cases for which the student is performing research or they may be part of unrelated cases. The precise nature of the assignments and observation opportunities in chambers is at the discretion of the judge and the judge\u2019s staff.",

The seminar will cover the underpinnings of the American legal profession and legal educational system with their changing models, methods, and values. The course will examine the origins of this history from its beginnings in medieval Italy to the Inns of Court in London to the earliest settlements in the colonies. The seminar will proceed to analyze the development after 1783 of the uniquely American approach to lawyer training and the practice of law. Students will study the emergence in the 19th century of the American model of institutional legal education, with a focus on Christopher Columbus Langdell's \"case method,\" and the development of the \"Cravath system\" of organizing and managing a legal practice.\n\nThe students will be exposed to the change and growth of law practice and law schools following both world wars, influenced by economic booms and busts, the expansion of the federal regulatory system, the acknowledgement that substantive knowledge and practical skills are equally essential to legal training, the increasing pressure to ensure equal access to legal education and legal representation for all segments of society, and the growing focus on social, environmental, and international concerns. The course will trace how the interrelationship of American law, society, economics, and ideologies have dramatically changed the practice of law as well as the priorities, policies, curriculums, and cultures of law schools. The seminar will conclude with an analysis of the current state of the legal profession and legal education. A unique and important aspect of the course will be the integration of material from the Law Library\u2019s Arthur C. Pulling Rare Books Collection.\n\nLL.M. students may request instructor permission to enroll.",

This regulatory trend has not significantly dwindled since and has in fact seen a boost with the rise of Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) and the so-called foreign fighters phenomenon, with every new incident prompting states and international organizations to contemplate additional legal and policy responses. Consequently, measures aimed at preventing and countering terrorism have now seeped into almost every aspect of domestic, regional or international policies and regulation, including education, banking and finances, immigration and asylum, Internet and communication technologies, the functioning of civil society, charitable and humanitarian organizations, etc.\n\nAgainst this background, the seminar aims to give students an overview of the international legal framework on terrorism and counter-terrorism. It will address the United Nations counter-terrorism architecture and the counter-terrorism response at the level of the United Nations as well as selected regional and domestic initiatives. Discussion will cover a wide range of topics, spanning from the definition of terrorism and the conditions conducive to its spread, to a broad spectrum of counter-terrorism measures, including criminalization of terrorist acts, investigating and prosecuting such acts and relevant fair trial issues, use of force against (suspected) terrorists, preventing terrorist use of the Internet and communication technologies, the foreign fighters phenomenon, etc. Counter-terrorism measures will consistently be analyzed against their compliance with international human rights law. The seminar will further examine the interplay between counter-terrorism regulation and the law governing armed conflict as well as international criminal law.\n\nStudents will study and discuss primary sources, such as international and regional treaties and conventions, United Nations Security Council and General Assembly resolutions, as well as policy documents and academic literature. Students will finish the seminar equipped with a working knowledge of the global legal regime against terrorism, including the main challenges faced in this area and current trends in regulation.",

From the founding of the republic to the present day, federalism issues have vexed the American people, their political institutions, and their judiciaries. Federalist decisions are often driven as much by cultural, social, and political forces as they are by any discernible legal doctrine. This seminar will enable the student to explore how historical currents have shaped the law of federalism, and how the law, in turn, has influenced historical developments. \n\nMany, if not all, federalism issues fall into one or more of three broad categories. The first is characterized by the phrase, \u201cWhat kind of nation?\u201d These issues go to the heart of what are/is the United States. The shorthand phrase, \u201claboratories of democracy,\u201d a concept originated by Justice Louis Brandeis, describes the second category. These issues explore how innovative state policies interact with limitations imposed by the Constitution. The third category I call, \u201credefining liberty.\u201d In the aftermath of the Civil War, the American people adopted the 14th Amendment to the Constitution, which added new express limitations on the power of the states. This Amendment compelled the American people and their governmental institutions to repeatedly revisit the Constitutional meaning of \u201cliberty.\u201d This class will critically examine issues from all three categories.  \n\nWhile the emphasis here is on the past, rarely has a topic of legal history been timelier. Each week, students will research, write about, and present to the class one or more legal issues in their historical context. The topics will delve into how Americans have viewed federalism from the 18th century, e.g. Chisholm v. Georgia, 2 US 419 (1793)(whether individual states enjoy sovereign immunity) to the 21st century. E.g.  Dobbs v. Jackson Women\u2019s Health Organization, et. al., 597 U.S. ___, (No. 10-1392, Decided 06/24/2022)(whether Mississippi\u2019s pre-viability prohibitions on elective abortions are unconstitutional).",

    "info": "In the last decade, there has been an increased emphasis on using the criminal justice system to help determine who is and who is not suitable to live and work in the United States. This phenomenon has had some increasingly interesting effects as the immigration apparatus has been for most of the history of the United States a civil and agency system. The increased reliance on the criminal justice system has caused some overlap of criminal justice norms- including concepts of right to counsel, detention and detainers and warrants. At the same time, the prosecution of federal migration crimes has skyrocketed in the same period to the point where the majority of all federal prisoners are imprisoned because of migration crimes.",

The course will examine important portions of each reform bill including the intended goals of legislators and other influential factors such as demographic, economic, and political data. The class will explore societal perceptions of race and immigration in primary source documents and multimedia from each reform period including film, music, art, and news stories.\n\nThis seminar is structured around major immigration reforms and the seminar will highlight the the Immigration Act of 1924, the Immigration and Nationality Act of 1965, the Illegal Immigration Reform and Immigrant Responsibility Act of 1996 and post-9/11 terrorism related immigration reforms in the 2000\u2019s. The course will be divided into two to three seminar sessions per reform period and for each era the seminar will examine the societal context that led to the legislation, the language of law, case law and the broader policies and assumptions that it reflects. Seminar discussions will also cover how portions of the law currently operate and fit into a historical immigration law narrative.",

RICO, however, has its limits. Courts are beginning to weigh in heavily against RICO\u0092s application to extraterritorial disputes. When RICO claims were alleged in the sex abuse cases against the Catholic Church, courts struck down the claims on the basis that the plaintiffs sought compensation for personal injuries, which are not within the scope of the statute.

The course will show how decisions that Attorneys General make often reflect the independence of the Office. This independence is most often revealed when Governors, legislatures, other elected officials, state agencies or the federal government exceed their constitutional or statutory authority.

The journey begins with pre-contemplation of birth and the practice of sterilization and eugenics and moves throughout gestations, Classified, upon birth, as \"Black,\" citizens face barriers to access rights and services afforded United States citizens guaranteed by law. The course questions how the lack of access to resources remains permissible under current law and looks at how it has impacted everything from the Black infant mortality and maternal health rates, maturation, family structure, housing, education, stability, and life expectancy. Further, we examine what economic legacies to Black Americans begin with from past generations and the transfer of intergenerational wealth. Lastly we examine how law actively worked against protecting the dignity of caring for Black Americans ancestor's final remains as it permitted Black bodies to be buried in unmarked mass graves, experimented on without consent, and dishonored.",

We will then consider how medical devices are paid for, the involvement of the federal government in that process, and the attendant regulatory scheme and the incentives it creates. We will also learn about the FDA and the ways it operates to assure safety and efficacy of medical devices and will explore how the promotion of medical devices is regulated by various federal agencies and the states. Finally, we will consider how HIPAA affects the flow of patient information between healthcare providers and medical device companies.",

Students meet once a week and explore sentencing processes in state and federal sentencing systems, the role of sentencing advocacy in securing favorable outcomes, the factors that influence its quality, and the insights from social scientists that can critique and improve it. The class draws on the wealth of interdisciplinary expertise on the University of Minnesota campus as well as in our local professional community.\n\nMost notably, however, the students learn by doing\u2014through hands-on involvement in actual clemency or 'second look' petitions. Each student gets their own case, under the Professor's supervision, and as such, will get to know a real human being and their family members, all of whom have served a substantial portion of a long sentence and have many more years to go. The student will strategize, research, and develop an effective clemency/second-look petition. Using a 'teaching hospital' format, and subject to a strict confidentiality protocol, students then brainstorm each other\u2019s cases, critique the clemency/secondlook strategy, and learn from any judicial or executive outcomes. \n",

Most significantly, students will learn themselves, through hands-on involvement in actual pending cases, how to strategize, research, and develop an effective sentencing petition. Thus, the class instructor will seek out cutting-edge/novel/interesting sentencing issues in the cases of court-appointed lawyers in state and federal cases (with the appointed lawyer's consent) for which students can draft the sentencing memoranda, research the sentencing guideline and mitigation issues, and develop the client's counter-narrative to the prosecutor's position.

The most obvious example of this trend is the Lehman Brothers group of companies: approximately 80 Lehman affiliates commenced insolvency proceedings in 16 countries. International Bankruptcy is a course designed to deal with this world of multi-jurisdictional insolvency.\n\nThe course consists of two modules, Comparative Insolvency Law and Managing Cross-Border Cases. The first module covers six class sessions. After an introductory session explaining the role of insolvency law in national economies and setting out the framework for comparative insolvency law, we will survey the insolvency laws of Canada, Brazil and Mexico, Japan and China, England and Western Europe. Common topics include prerequisites that must be satisfied before an insolvency case can be filed, whether an automatic stay of collection and other proceedings exists, how the case is administered (judicial, administrative or other), and whether the system is focused on liquidation or permits reorganization. We will then turn to \"Managing Cross-Border Cases.\" We will devote two sessions to the European Union's insolvency regulation that co-ordinates insolvency proceedings pending in EU nations. Four sessions will analyze chapter 15 of the U.S. Bankruptcy Code. Chapter 15 facilitates cooperation among courts in countries in which related insolvency proceedings are pending. Our final session will focus on the use of chapter 11 by foreign entities.",

    "info": "This course introduces students to the original meaning and significance of religious law and ethics within Judaism. Law is the single most important part of Jewish history and identity. At the same time, law is also the least understood part of Judaism and has often been the source of criticism and hatred. We shall therefore confront one of the most important parts of Jewish civilization and seek to understand it on its own terms. In demonstrating how law becomes a fundamental religious and ethical ideal, the course will focus on the biblical and Rabbinic periods but spans the entire history of Judaism. Consistent with the First Amendment, the approach taken is secular. There are no prerequisites: the course is open to all qualified students.\n\nThe course begins with ideas of law in ancient Babylon and then studies the ongoing history of those ideas. The biblical idea that a covenant binds Israel to God, along with its implications for human worth - including the view of woman as person - will be examined. Comparative cultural issues include the reinterpretations of covenant within Christianity and Islam. The course investigates the rabbinic concept of oral law, the use of law to maintain the civil and religious stability of the Jewish people, and the kabbalistic transformation of law. The course concludes with contemporary Jewish thinkers who return to the Bible while seeking to establish a modern system of universal ethics.\n\nThe course investigates the historical origins of the premise of the American founding: the idea that \"all men [humans] are created equal.\" How does it become \"self-evident\" that every human is or should be a legal person, with rights that should properly be inviolable? The course employs the method of academic religious studies to teach the immense cultural contributions of antiquity to illuminate and help address contemporary cultural problems. The course also investigates the origins of constitutional thought in antiquity and provides comparative evidence to shed new light on current debates about the relation of the Supreme Court (as interpreters) to the normative text of the American Constitution. \n\nThe premise of the course is the discipline of academic religious studies. The assumptions of the course are therefore academic and secular, as required by the First Amendment. All texts and all religious traditions will be examined analytically and critically. Students are expected to understand and master this approach, which includes questioning conventional cultural assumptions about the composition and authorship of the Bible. Willingness to ask such questions and openness to new ways of thinking are essential to success in the course.",

This course brings practitioner and academic perspectives together to focus on the major civil, administrative and criminal laws that have been used to contain health care fraud and abuse, broadly defined as actions by health care providers (e.g., physicians and physician practices, medical device and pharmaceutical manufacturers, clinical laboratories) that are inconsistent with accepted business and medical practices. These laws include the federal civil False Claims Act, the Stark Act, the federal Anti-kickback Statute and the remedies and civil and criminal penalties available to governmental entities and civil litigants.

This seminar will provide that foundation. It aims to equip prospective legal professionals with the tools to understand the basic concepts of coding relating to technologies and applications that are changing the legal profession. This will enable them to become familiar with the design and operation of legal technologies.\n\nGiven that information is increasingly being stored electronically, coding is of value because it assists with searching, organising, filtering and presenting information. This is of particular use for the purposes of discovery in litigation. In addition, data analytics and artificial intelligence use algorithms which facilitate research and review activities, conducting these tasks in ways that are cheaper and faster than human lawyers. Since these techniques are code-based, lawyers will draw value in the medium to long term from understanding these skills and systems.\n \nThis seminar provides: an introduction to legal tech in the digital age; an overview of lawyers as project managers; an overview of artificial intelligence and its impact on legal tech; an introduction to programming in Python, machine learning and natural language processing techniques as part of legal tech solutions; and insights into the latest trends in legal tech.

Class time is devoted to training and case work.\n\nStudents are assigned cases and expected to gather source materials such as police reports and transcripts. They will organize and summarize those materials. After educating themselves about their cases, students will design and implement an investigative plan with their supervisor and pursue that investigation. This may include locating evidence, experts and witnesses. If proof of innocence is developed they may draft post- conviction motions. Interested students may also participate in policy work.\n\nThis clinic puts students on the cutting edge of scientific and social science issues that affect the practice of law in the criminal justice system as well as hands-on experience in managing and analyzing large-scale cases for litigation.",

Students will strengthen their legal analytical skills by engaging in critical analysis of issues raised in the clinic\u2019s cases. They will learn strategies to become mini-experts in the subject matter of each project, as well as learn general skills in appellate practice. They will strengthen their written advocacy abilities through brief and memorandum writing under close supervision of and in collaboration with the clinic director. They will strengthen their oral advocacy skills through oral arguments (when possible), simulations, or class presentations. The clinic also will foster skills in collaboration, as students will work in teams on case assignments and engage with all clinic participants in case rounds. Finally, students will hone their ability to conduct themselves in a professional manner while working with clinic clients and co-counsel.\n\nIn the weekly seminar, students will study key aspects of appellate advocacy, strategize on casework, and engage with guest speakers who are experts in the appellate field.\n",
