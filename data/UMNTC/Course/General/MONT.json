    "info": "The focus of this course is an exploration of the creative work of a period of history that remains to this day shrouded in mystery. There are strong parallels between the Medieval era and the present day: It is a time when many live in fear. Power, often wielded tyrannically, lies in the hands of a fortunate few, and those at the bottom of the social pyramid are cowed into submission. The Church, seeking to expand its social control, reinforces that terror through cryptic and troubling iconography. Just as in the present day, fear drives superstitions about\nmarvels and monsters to society\u2019s surface. Yet at the same time, a developing curiosity for the world but also a desire for conquest emerge and encounter the Other. Understanding the context and forces at work in this period will provide students with tools to analyze contemporary societal shifts; in other words, exploring the myths of the past will shed a light on those that govern the present.\n\nDuring the semester, students will discover the mysteries, marvels, and monsters of this period through literature and visual media. The goal will be to study these works from diverse perspectives, but also to see how this imagery and these legends have persisted through the ages to the present day (for example Victor Hugo\u2019s 19th-Century romantic poetry and Alexandre Astier\u2019s popular 21st-Century series Kaamelott). Students will explore changes in the literature from the past to the present (theater, poetry, prose) as well as architecture and\nthe arts in an attempt to access a deeper comprehension of this often misunderstood time that can inform our understanding of the present.\n\nThis is a writing-intensive course, offering a broad introduction to the critical methods, standards of scholarship, and body of knowledge specific to the discipline of French and francophone studies. The course will train students to understand and analyze texts and visual media, including sculpture, painting, manuscript illuminations, and film. Since it is writing intensive, particular attention is given to the content, style, and format of written assignments.",

From the Middle Ages to the present day in such popular works as George RR Martin\u2019s Game of Thrones, the myths and folklore surrounding the king have been ceaselessly renewed. Beginning with the pseudo-historical origins of Arthur and his knights in the old French literary tradition as depicted by Chr\u00e9tien de Troyes and in iconic works of the mati\u00e8re de Bretagne, and ending with Alexandre Astier\u2019s wildly popular television series, Kaamelott, this course will seek to shed light on the popularity and the mystery surrounding le roi Arthur. Over the course of the semester we will explore the legendary material in detail, constantly comparing and contrasting contemporary works with their Medieval forbears with the ultimate goal of understanding how these creations function within a socio-cultural framework.",

The course aims to address the main issues surrounding the intensive human use of the environment to be able to provide a growing population with healthy food in a sustainable way. We\u2019ll be paying special attention to water use, soil management, loss of biological diversity, and the challenges posed by global climate change.\n\nGlobal food production poses the greatest threat to natural ecosystems and is the largest driver of environmental degradation. Therefore, the course will help students understand, reflect on, and analyze some of the ways the Mediterranean food production system in the south of France is responding to these challenges. It will focus on the three main geographical areas surrounding Montpellier: the lagoons, coastal plains, and mountains, as well as the main productive activities of each ecosystem. By focusing on the current technical innovations proposed for the region\u2019s food system development, students will be able to explore some of the main solutions currently proposed to tackle the need to produce food while conserving the natural environment and the region\u2019s cultural heritage.",

Is that even a valid question? What are the origins of the French, and specifically how might a work of literature or a film reveal the various dimensions of their cultural identity? With these questions in mind, the first third of the course focuses on the history of immigration in France and the complex nature of the issue as it stands at the beginning of the 21st Century. The second third of the course is centered on mainland France, with a particular focus on those regions and populations asserting claims of independence (Pays Basque, La Corse, la Bretagne) or with strong cultural identities; we will also examine the role of minority languages, and a selection of literary works and films will serve to illustrate some of the distinctive features of each region. A similar approach will be used in the final part of the course, which will examine the rich diversity of the francophone world, and consider its influence on France\u2019s pluralistic identity.\nThis is a writing-intensive course, offering a broad introduction to the critical methods, standards of scholarship, and body of knowledge specific to the discipline of French and francophone studies. The course will train students to understand and analyze texts and visual media, including sculpture, painting, manuscript illuminations, and film. Since it is writing intensive, particular attention is given to the content, style, and format of written assignments.",

Over the course of the semester, students will learn how to write a variety of different types of texts including: the description, the compte rendu universitaire, the journalistic portrait, and other textual genres. The course consists of an analytic component in which students will be asked to study a text corresponding to a specific style. Students are then asked to explore the writing techniques employed in each type: reformulation, synthesis, rhetorical figures, persuasive language, expressing an opinion via judgment or values, impersonal language, inverted questioning of the reader, etc. and subsequently write in those styles.\n\nStudents will be expected to complete numerous writing assignments during the semester. These exercises will be collected and graded on a regular basis, with the possibility for students to revise and improve each project. Course objectives include: learning how to write different types of documents, with different content, using different styles, applying the knowledge acquired in the grammar/methodology course, mastering the stylistic tools and techniques for writing in French (e.g., the use of hyperbole, metaphor, personification, diction, symbolism) acquiring the ability to think in French and write directly in the target language without translating.",

Students will engage in charities/French schools and then share their experience in a classroom. They will discuss topics linked to French society at large, approaching diverse subjects such as the youth in French society, the way the education system works in France and how it differs from the US, the French social system, the concept of \u201cla\u00efcit\u00e9\u201d (secularism) in France, the history of immigration from the 19th Century until today with the new waves of immigrant population, and race and gender issues. Students will have a closer look at French charity organization, NGO, and see how they work here in France. They will also examine leadership values in their country and see how they can adapt and develop them in their new environment. \n\nThis course and students' engagement in the community will deepen their understanding of the host country cultural context and will lead them to critically examine their own worldviews. Topics explored will include ethic and social responsibility, leadership, French social systems, multiculturalism in the French society, place of secularism (la\u00efcit\u00e9) in the French society, history of immigration, and gender equality.",

The MOOC, Resilience in Children Exposed to Trauma, Disaster and War: Global Perspectives, is taught by Professor Ann S. Masten, Ph.D., LP from the University of Minnesota. Students will participate fully in the MOOC (see the detailed MOOC syllabus) in addition to attending seminar sessions in France (see schedule below). Students will experience global interaction by participating in a live MOOC online with other participants around the world combined with face-to-face dialogue in a seminar at the Program Center.",
