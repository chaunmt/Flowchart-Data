The course provides students with an extensive preparation on what are the most important asset of Made in Spain products: their ability to represent a paradigm shift. The course explores the evolutionary phenomena of the four F's (fashion and footwear, food and wines, furniture and building materials, and fabricated metal products and machinery) as well as design, renewable energy, railway construction, e-commerce, and other industrial sectors. The course will lead students to understand the evolutionary strategic Made in Spain management and philosophy.\n\nThe Spain Brand has appreciably revalued in the last four years (Repsol, Telef\u00f3nica, Acciona, Endesa), thanks above all to the presence of Spanish products throughout the world and in all areas of activity, of which we lead in at least a dozen.\n\nThe internationalization accomplished by Spanish companies has allowed them to have a leading position (among the first ten countries in the world) in the food industry, fashion, gastronomy, technology, research, renewable energy, railway construction, organ transplantation, and sports.\n\nFrom Antoni Gaud\u00ed to the Culdesac studio, including \u00d3scar Tusquets and Nani Marquina, Spain has always been a benchmark for quality design with international projection. This course looks at Made in Spain from both an economic and business point of view and shows a brief tour of the world of national designers and some of its most emblematic pieces.\n\nThe Spanish fashion industry plays a fundamental role in economic development, with around 19,500 companies that make a contribution to GDP of 2.8%, and in the context of a highly competitive globalized market. As a result, Spain achieves the fifth place in importance in Europe after Italy, Germany, the United Kingdom, and France, both in production volume and in employment. This is due in large part to the design of products with high added value, leather and footwear accessories, and the use of modern marketing and distribution techniques that have revolutionized the sector.\n",

It covers important data structures and algorithms, as well as analysis of algorithms, and algorithm paradigms such as greedy algorithms and divide-and-conquer. \n\nIt is 4 credits, with 3 hours/week in lecture, and 1 hour/week in discussion. Discussion can be used for problem solving and review, or more in-depth discussion of topics and examples given in lecture. Since many students struggle with topics like analyzing algorithms, identifying what algorithms/data structures are appropriate to use in given situations, etc., the practice given in discussion can be valuable.
