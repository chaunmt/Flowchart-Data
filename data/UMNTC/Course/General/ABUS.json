Students will learn to understand writing expectations in their disciplines and develop techniques for brainstorming, organizing, outlining, and researching. Students will also practice the drafting process, focusing on mastering business grammar, avoiding common mistakes, and cultivating a clear and concise style. Students will learn the components of clear structure such as transitioning between ideas, logical organization, and integrating research. Students will also develop reliable editing techniques to test their own writing for clarity, logic, and appropriate tone, as well as methods for thinking through critical feedback and incorporating changes into revisions of existing documents.

Inclusion and multiculturalism take center stage. Through self-examination and reflection within the context of their own experience, students will explore the concepts of identity, privilege, and conscious and unconscious bias, as well as their financial impacts on the organization. They will identify ways they can mitigate racial workplace bias by holding themselves and their organization accountable. The concept of allyship will also be explored. Students will learn how, by putting allyship into practice, they can contribute to the creation of an antiracist work environment. By building empathy, embracing difference, and using emotional intelligence techniques, they will learn how to foster diversity, inclusion, and equity. Throughout the course, they will develop an understanding of the ways recognition of individual racial bias will unlock the potential of both themselves and the organization.\n\nPrerequisites: None",

This course will provide an understanding of ways to find, research, and write proposals for grants offered by government and private entities. As a writing intensive course, it will spend significant time focusing on the writing process. Writing is crucial to the field because the only way for a nonprofit to be awarded a grant is by submitting a written proposal. The strength of the proposal has a significant impact on the money that an organization will receive. Students will become familiar with various sections of the proposal by drafting, editing, and seeking feedback and by revising a needs assessment, goal statement, budget justification, and statement of organizational purpose. By learning how to write well in the field, students will increase their chances of being employed by a nonprofit and securing funding for their organization.",
