Such a characterization paints Christians in unfairly broad strokes, ignoring their diversity of views. If the media portrayal is inaccurate, how does Christianity really interact with the issues we face in American society today? This is the theme we will explore in this course. We will focus our study on Christian beliefs as grounded in the Bible. We will see that Christians understand their holy book in different ways and come to very different conclusions about its application to societal issues. We will explore different Christian perspectives, noting how conservative and liberal Christians both ground their beliefs in biblical texts, yet hold opposing views. Gender, gay rights, abortion, and immigration are just a few of the topics we will explore as we investigate the interaction of Biblical Christianity with 21st century American issues.",

From a wide array of perspectives, we\u2019ll seek to balance critical analysis with creativity as we attempt to understand how the concept of paradise has both inspired and oppressed. We will also pay special attention to how the College of Liberal Arts at the University of Minnesota has been imagined and shaped as a paradise over its 150-year history.

We will explore the relation between language, food, and identity in spontaneous conversations among people eating a variety of foods.

It may be a spiritual awakening, an educational epiphany, or a transformative personal moment. There will be ample time for personal reflection and contemplation as well as group experiences. You will be encouraged to use your time on the camino to discover something that holds special meaning for you whether it is spiritual, a rite of passage, personal transformation or just openness to new experiences. We will all engage in reverent travel which is a practice that spans traditions and religions.",
