The course emphasis is on developing fundamental relationships that describe how the behavior of one phase is influenced by its interaction with the other phase.  \n\nThe course will be divided into four sections. In the first, transport of dilute systems of rigid particles in a gaseous or liquid medium is examined at the single particle level.  Students will be taught how to construct and numerically solve Lagrangian particle tracking models with one-way coupling and will be provided with codes to compute the free molecular drag force on particles of arbitrary shape (IMoS).  In the second section, the course will discuss dense dispersed media, including effective medium approximations to describe thermal and electrical transport in complex systems, an introduction to foams and unit cells, flow in porous media, and granular systems (four-way coupled systems).  In the third section, the course will return to dilute systems, but wherein the dispersed phase is deformable (droplets).  Topics will include droplet behavior on a surface (wetting and line tension), an introduction to emulsions, droplet-droplet coalescence, and atomization processes.  The fourth and final section of the course, phase change and multiphase system formation will be introduced, including the kinetics of nucleation of condensed phase material in a gas, as well as solid (ice) formation in a liquid.  The overarching goal of the course is to prepare PhD and MS students to be able to address research level questions experimentally, numerically, and theoretically in their studies beyond the course.\n",

    "info": "Smart materials are an emergent class of stimuli-responsive materials. For example, in response to a change in temperature, shape memory alloys change their shape, alternatively, a magnetic field applied to a magneto-rheological material causes a change in the material stiffness. A smart structure is assembled to use the smart properties of its individual components. Smart materials and structures hold promise to provide integrated sensing, actuation, computation, and communication in a single material system. Successful integration of specific functionalities includes self-healing, self-cooling, deployable structures, structural health monitoring, combined sensor/actuator material systems, and\nenergy harvesting for various medical and rehabilitative devices, aerospace structures, and consumer products.\n\nThis course covers the phenomenological material performance and design approaches for smart materials and structures. A fundamental understanding of the underlying mechanisms and graphical and mathematical representations of the mechanical behavior of the material and structures is necessary to design these systems. The fundamental material behavior and structural modeling approaches will be covered through lectures, while students in the course will present recent research developments. The course will provide experience in design with smart materials and structures, reporting of research results through written and oral presentations, and critical analysis of recent research publications. Motivated students from a broad range of disciplines are encouraged to join.",
