This involves understanding the parameters that are used to characterize antennas and how these effect system performance. An important aspect of the course is to provide the student with an understanding of the operating principles behind the most commonly used antennas. This is followed with exposure to basic design principles. These can be used to perform antenna design or can be used as starting points for design using an electromagnetic simulator.

This class covers the basic physics of infrared emission and absorption in solid-state materials, molecules, and the atmosphere. It also discusses detector technology (with particular emphasis on types of semiconductor and quantum-dot photon detectors, microbolometers, and thermoelectric detectors) and the infrared spectroscopy of molecules to show why the infrared is so important in the study of chemical, biological, and atmospheric systems. The class will also examine types of commonly used spectrometers: cavity, dispersive, and FTIR and sampling of important applications: passive and active standoff detection, satellite climate and atmospheric monitoring, industrial and petrochemical analysis, and LIDAR.

The other half of the course will be devoted to data-driven approximation of dynamical systems: i.e., given empirical data generated by a dynamical system, determine a mathematical representation for the underlying system dynamics.

The objective of this class is to provide a view of this emerging universe and acquaint students with new research in this area. Specific topics to be covered include 1) Overview of technology trends and emerging systems 2) Variation-aware design and 3) Design automation issues.\n\nPrerequisites: CSE grad student. Some background in VLSI design and/or design automation is suggested but not required. Such prior exposure will make the experience in the class much more meaningful.",

Recent interest in learning methods is triggered by the widespread use of digital technology and availability of data. Unfortunately, developments in each field are seldom related to other fields. This course is concerned with estimation of predictive data-analytic models that are estimated using past data, but are used for prediction or decision making with new data. This course will first present general conceptual framework for learning predictive models from data, using Vapnik-Chervonenkis (VC) theoretical framework, and then discuss various methods developed in statistics, pattern recognition and machine learning. Course descriptions will emphasize methodological aspects of machine learning, rather than development of \u0091new\u0092 algorithms.\n\nprereq: CSE grad student or instr consent",

High power quality and availability are maintained in the bulk power\nsystem mainly by enforcing hierarchical operational practices, central decision making, and topological\nredundancy. However, this status quo is being challenged by changing generation, consumption\nand operational landscapes. Particularly, increased renewable generation, supply scarcity, the impetus\nto improve resiliency to extenuating weather impacts, and expanding electricity access call for the\ndevelopment of transformative architectural and operational paradigms. Recognizing these developments,\nthis course will present enabling modeling, analysis, and control methods that will be integral to\narchitect next-generation renewable-based power systems. These methods will be developed adopting\na bottom-up approach by leveraging recent theoretical advances in circuit theory, nonlinear systems,\ncomplex networks, and stochastic processes.",
