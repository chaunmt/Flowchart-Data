You'll explore basic botany, soils and compost, species and variety selection, planning and design, container gardening, pest management, season extension, and more so you can approach your gardening projects with confidence.\n\nWe will begin by taking a look at the fundamentals of organic gardening, then move onto an overview of basic plant science principles. Following this introduction, course content will focus on how these principles can be applied practically in the planning and management of an organic garden, whether that be in your yard, on your patio, or at a school or community site. \n\nThis course isn\u2019t so much about memorizing facts as it is about you becoming a well-informed gardener who can make educated decisions and seek out reliable answers to questions or problems that might come up. \n\nThe course is presented entirely online and makes extensive use of discussions, interactive activities, worksheets, and multimedia projects that get you immersed in a host of gardening topics. Short video segments in each module highlight key topics and provide information to guide you as you work through the readings, activities, and assignments.",

This course aims to increase student's knowledge of ecological concepts as applied to managing organic systems, with an emphasis on soil nutrient cycles and plant-soil-microbe interactions that serve as the cornerstone of organic systems. Students in this course will learn tools needed to manage an organic diversified vegetable operation. The course consists of two components. The lecture session is designed to help students think about concepts and principles that are useful in planning and managing production strategies on organic farms. We spend a significant amount of our time reviewing soil nutrient cycling and its critical importance for organic farms, including how to effectively use soil and organic nutrient inputs such as cover crops, manure and fertilizers, to provide vegetable crops with the nutrients they need to grow. We also learn about successful marketing strategies for organic produce. Finally, near the end of the semester we will discuss pest management, including both weeds and disease/insect pests, and compare different tillage options available to organic producers. What we learn is then applied to planning next year's season of the UMN student organic farm. Throughout, we will use case studies, guest speakers, games, and active learning discussion approaches to move these classroom sessions \"beyond the lecture\" and allow students to engage with the material in a meaningful way. The lab is designed to allow a space to put into action some of the concepts students learn in lecture, including soil organic matter analysis, microgreen propagation, calculation of organic fertilizer rates, and operation of driven and walk-behind tractors.\n\nprereq: Agro 1101 or 1103 or Biol 1001 or 1009 or Hort 1001",

In addition, the knowledge of traditional Chinese medicine and herb uses, systems and methods for Chinese herbal classification, identification will also be introduced.

Flowering Trees and Shrubs is a practitioners course, designed to give you a hands-on opportunity to learn to identify woody landscape trees, shrubs, ground covers, and vines, including the common and scientific names for each. We will study the plants as family assemblages, noting features common to each family which will assist you in identifying unknown plants in Minnesota and other geographical locations in the future.
