This course is not for students starting out in research. It is intended for students who already have been working in the research group of the mentor and have developed an independent research project. In this course the student will receive writing instruction through a writing support course (corresponding to 1 credit in addition to the credits of directed research time) that will meet weekly throughout the semester. The written output usually is in the form of a scientific paper describing the results of the student's project. Written output of the course must be revised during the semester and a schedule for writing, assessment, and revision needs to be in place at the beginning of the semester. The project needs to be explained in the campus Directed Research contract and the project and participation in the writing support course agreed on by both the student and faculty mentor. The contract must be approved by the Director of Undergraduate Studies (DUGS) for the major before the student is allowed to register. The contract includes a description of learning objectives for the course, agreement about how writing instruction will take place, confirmation of understanding of the timeline for when student writing will be handed in and how it will be assessed, methodology to be used by the student, and how assessment of learning will be conducted by the mentor. Additional oversight is established for this course - near the end of the semester the written output is submitted to the DUGS for the major. The DUGS is responsible to determine that the writing meets standards set by the CBS Education Policy Committee for quality of writing, appropriate citation of literature, well-constructed figures, tables, and legends (if present), appropriate use and interpretation of statistics (if present), conclusions that are supported by evidence, and well-formatted references. The DUGS can call for a final revision before a grade is given. This course is graded S/N by the writing support course instructor, and approval of both the DUGS and the research mentor is required before a grade of S can be given by the writing support course instructor.\n\nThis course is for non-Honors students.

This class is not intended as a final step in this understanding, but as a first step into these issues. At the conclusion of the class, you should have sufficient understanding to continue more in-depth reading and study in these issues.  \n\nThere are no official prerequisites. However, I have found that students who have EITHER a strong computational background (computer science, mathematics, economics, physics) OR have taken an introductory neuroscience course (e.g. NSCI 2100) have done better in the class than students with no background. However, I have seen students come in with very little background and do well in the class if they engage with the class and work hard.",

Topics are chosen with a focus on current areas of active research, as well as problems that have driven the field over the past twenty years. The class will combine lectures with discussions of important systems neuroscience papers, and will move at a fast pace. It is intended for graduate students and ambitious undergraduates.\n\nOne major difference between this course and other math and statistics courses is the focus on systems neuroscience. Our examples will come from the Systems Neuroscience field. Our research priorities will come from Systems Neuroscience and our Friday paper discussions will draw exclusively from scholarly papers in Systems Neuroscience. \n",
