Through Baron de Coubertin?s efforts the first Olympic Games of the modern era took place in 1896 in Athens, Greece. From a small sporting event that hosted a little over 300 athletes from 13 countries the Olympic Games have grown over the last 120 years to one of the most viewed sporting events in the world.  Today, the Olympic Games hosts over 10,0000 athletes from over 200 countries. The International Olympic Committee (IOC), which runs the Olympic Games, is now one of the most powerful and richest sporting organizations in the world.  The Olympic Games have had a profound impact on the world we live in and they provide us with a platform for examining changes in the world?s cultural, economic, social and political processes over the last 120 years. This course explores the impact of the Olympic Games on the world?s cultural, social and political processes. In addition, this course will explore the impact of hosting the Olympic Games on that host city and the country?s economy.  Finally, this course will explore the changes in sport that have occurred during this time span. \n\n",

Upon completing this course, students will be able to use proper anatomical terminology and identify the majority of the human anatomical structures and their functions. The lecture series is organized around an organ systems approach and currently follows the text of Human Anatomy. The lectures are divided into basic anatomy and human development principles and the major anatomical systems: skin, musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, respiratory, renal, neurological, endocrine, immune, and digestive. Each section proceeds an anatomic description from the microscopic or cellular level to the key features of tissues that aggregate into organ anatomy (bottom up). The kinetic anatomy perspective describes organ systems' dynamic and functional characteristics based on their component organ anatomy and interactions (top-down). The context for course material covered will reflect a kinesiology focus on human movement in exercise and sports. This will better prepare students for graduate school courses in the health sciences, movement sciences, and Athletic Training. In addition, students will be encouraged to learn their anatomy as a health and preventive medicine skill. The laboratory component is divided into two; one identifies cells, tissues, and bones and the different bone parts. These activities are performed in the Human Performance Teaching Laboratory (HPTL) in Mariucci Arena 141. Laboratory activities include using light microscopes to identify cells and tissues and working with individual bones and intact skeletons. The second component is the cadaver lab at the Anatomy Bequest Program. Students will have the opportunity to visualize and identify anatomical structures in cadavers and cadavers specimens during these labs. The cadaver labs provide students with the three-dimensional organization of the human anatomy and the association with neighboring anatomical structures. The instructors will demonstrate the functional anatomical aspects and clinical anatomical correlations. Students are able to further complement their understanding of human anatomy by using anatomy and physiology virtual labs.",

This study abroad global seminar will explore first-hand the Kenyan culture and the unique chances for physical activity and movement made available to Kenyan youth, both males and females. Students will be introduced to different individual and community organizations\u2019 efforts to provide activity opportunities to youth. They will interact with these organizations to learn how physical activity and sport extends beyond just bodily movement and exercise, but provides long-term opportunities for youth. Students will actively learn about the myriad of personal, social, cultural, and environmental challenges that face Kenyan youth to engage in sports and physical activity and how youth navigate these challenges. Students will engage in several service projects and discuss activity in the context of Kenyan culture, while remaining cognizant of their own American culture. All of this work will be completed in the context of exploring the distinctive and specific elements of the Kenyan culture compared to the US culture.\n\nStudents enrolled in the course will travel throughout Kenya (capital city of Nairobi to rural, mountainous Iten to centrally-located Mt. Kenya to the coastal area of Mombasa) to experience physical activity and sport from various perspectives including: primary aged children engaged in ballet and football (soccer); high school aged students recruited to participate in sport at prestigious boarding schools; adult athletes who have been engaged in activity since childhood and now handling family life with the love of their sport; and elite runners whose lives revolve around eating, sleeping, and training; \n",

    "info": "KIN 3327 addresses inquiry, research, and reflection through class projects, reading assignments, discussions, and team-teaching. Inquiry is addressed as classroom teachers review several sources in order to formulate a philosophy about physical education and its importance in the lives of the students they teach. Research takes place as students delve into current curriculum practices, methodology and strategies as well as knowledge of age level characteristics and developmentally appropriate activities. Reflection is twofold as student\u2019s team-teach a variety of lessons. Students must present post reflective comments on their own teaching as well as offering positive comment as peers present physical education lessons.\n\nThis course is activity based and is designed to give the classroom teacher the ability to teach elementary physical education with age appropriate, energizing activities. We will be utilizing the classroom and the gymnasium for instruction and team-teaching. Gymnasium classes will be active, experiencing current curriculum ideas and methodology. As classroom teachers, please realize the importance of physical education to the total school curriculum including the health, social, and emotional benefits for the child.",

This course provides the biological principles for how the body works, from the function of intracellular organelles to the interactions between systems and the role of each organ. It explains the relationship between structure and function and describes the development of diseases when the physiological systems become impaired. \n\nThis course in human physiology builds on knowledge obtained using the basic sciences of math, chemistry, and physics. Thus, understanding some of these sciences' basic principles is essential to fully understanding the physiological principles during this course. \n\nThe lab component of this course takes place at the Human Performance Teaching Laboratory (HPTL). Lab activities are an interactive component of the course. During labs, students will perform a series of experiments, record data, and will provide a physiological interpretation for the results. \n\nThe combination of lecture material and laboratory experience will allow students to understand disease mechanisms, comprehend the strategies to prevent and treat the most frequent medical conditions, and live a healthy life. The instructor's goal is not just to teach the most up-to-date knowledge on human physiology but also to arouse your curiosity so you continue learning beyond this course. \n\nprereq: [KIN 3027 or ANAT 3001 or ANAT 3601 or ANAT 3611 or ANAT 3651 or ANAT 3658H ] and [Kin or Physical Activity and Health Promotion Major] or instr consent",

The city of Los Angeles, California is about to host the Summer Olympic  Games for the third time (e.g., 1932, 1984 & 2028). The first Los Angeles Olympic Games were held in 1932 and Los Angeles was just starting to be a city of influence in the United States. A number of countries voiced an objection to the Olympic Games being held in Los Angeles. However, the 1932 Los Angeles Summer Olympic Games proved to be a success. These Olympic Games proved that Los Angeles was an emerging city not only in the United States but in the world. The second Los Angeles Summer Olympics were held in 1984 and followed the 1980 Moscow Summer Olympics, which the United States and other countries boycotted. In retaliation, the Soviet Union as well as other communist countries boycotted the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympics.  Even with the boycott the 1984 Los Angeles Summer Olympic Games were a huge success. They demonstrated that the Olympic Games could be hosted and not create a financial calamity for the hosting city, but actually create a legacy for the hosting city to build upon. In 2028 Los Angeles will host the Summer Olympic Games for a third time, joining London, England and  Paris, France as the only cities to host the Summer Olympics three times. What will happen to Los Angeles and the United States after they host the 2028 Summer Olympic Games? Will the 2028 Summer Olympic Games be as successful as the previous two Los Angeles Summer Olympic Games? This course will explore the impact of each of these Summer  Olympic Games as well as contributions that these Olympic Games have had not only on society in the United States but also the world. In addition, this course will explore the changes in sport that have occurred during this time span in the United States as well as the world. \n",

From a small sporting event that hosted a little over 300 athletes from 13 countries the Olympic Games have grown over the last 120 years to one of the most viewed sporting events in the world.  Today, the Olympic Games hosts over 10,000 athletes from over 200 countries. The International Olympic Committee (IOC), which runs the Olympic Games, is now one of the most powerful and richest sporting organizations in the world.  The Olympic Games have had a profound impact on the world we live in and they provide us with a platform for examining changes in the world's cultural, economic, social and political processes over the last 120 years. This course explores the impact of a specific Olympic Game(s) held on that host city's culture, economy and political landscape.
