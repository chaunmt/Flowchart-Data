How can poetry be a force of social change? How can poetry be a vehicle that repairs or aids in the recovery of social violence? Poetry, which derives from the term \"poiesis,\" and means 'making' or 'creation,' is often seen as a means to express personal experience and as a way of generating new forms of collective imagination, but it is less often seen as something that can lead to social change or revolution. In this course, we will ask what makes a poem a poem and explore ideas about poetry's capacity for expression and activity, interpretation and change, thinking and acting. We'll read poetry that attempts to repair the damage wrought by political, environmental, and social destruction by looking at the role of poetry in social struggles.",

Second, we will investigate the history of journalism, from the nineteenth century crisis of \"yellow journalism\" to our present day, post-truth news media climate. For example, when did journalists begin to strive for ideals of objectivity, impartiality, and fact-based reporting?

    "info": "This course starts from the premise that representation is where culture and politics meet, and it tests the hypothesis that pandemics radically transform representation. There are times in history when it takes a global pandemic to see the world in a different light: these are times when a pandemic makes us understand our place in the world differently. How and why do pandemics change the ways we represent the world and ourselves? Or, do they? To answer these questions, we will examine a great variety of representations of life, culture, and society in the time of pandemics: we will watch films, documentaries, and musicals; we will look at photography, paintings, memes, and other visual arts; we will read novels, poems, diaries, and autobiographies; we will study works of philosophy, essays of cultural criticism, and political commentary from various media sources. We will do all that by focusing on two current and ongoing pandemics\u2014theHIV/AIDS pandemic and the SARS-CoV-2/COVID-19 pandemic. In particular, we will consider the cultural and political responses to the AIDS pandemic in the 1980s and 1990s and to the COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, both in the U.S. and worldwide: we will investigate how these pandemics are linked to systemic oppressions (e.g., racism, misogyny, xenophobia, homophobia, transphobia), how they have transformed the relation between our individual rights and our responsibilities to society, how they have impacted sex and love and friendship, how they have changed the way we think about life and death, how they have enabled new and different forms of sociality, communication, and representation. Ultimately, however, it is not only a matter of representing the world differently: it is also a question of changing it. This is where culture meets politics. The word \u201crepresentation,\u201d in fact, means not only cultural or aesthetic representation (e.g., as in the way a film represents an aspect of reality); it also means political representation (e.g., as in the way elected officials represent us in democratic governance). Pandemics radically transform representation in both these senses: they transform both culture and politics. In the end, thus, the fundamental question of the course is: how can our representations of the world help bring about the change we want in the world?",

In thinking of gender and race as well, these pulps generally broke into forms either in tandem with Melodrama or the lie within the tenets of the post-created genre, Film Noir.

This course addresses this question by exploring the complexity of Jewish culture in modernity, with a focus on 20th and 21st century German and American literature. We will first tackle the open-ended and endlessly productive question of what is meant by Jewish culture. What is a Jewish writer and is there such a thing as Jewish writing? What makes a text ? How do Jewish authors challenge the assumptions of majority culture in their work? What role do multilingualism and translation play in the formation of Jewish cultures at the margins? We will trace the lines of affinity between the U.S. and Europe to explore the entangled histories of Germans and Jews, and between German Jews and Turkish Germans, as we look at works that challenge and expand the definition of Jewishness in the 20th century. Additional topics to be considered include how the legacies of American slavery and European colonialism shape our understandings of the Nazi genocide of the Jews, and whether Jewish writing should be understood under the rubric of whiteness? Moving beyond the approach to German Jewish literary studies anchored in Weimar Germany, we will explore the circulation of Jewish memory between Europe and the U.S. in the aftermath of the Holocaust. We will read works by, among others, Franz Kafka, Paul Celan, Gershon Scholem, Hannah Arendt, Benjamin Stein, Walter Benjamin, Barbara Honigmann, H\u00e9l\u00e8ne Cixous, Raymond Federman, W.G.

And it will introduce students to some of the basic methods of comparative literary study such as close reading, genre analysis, etymology, stylistics, and translation.   We will discuss classic problems confronted within comparative literature such as collective authorship, the spirit of a people, the historical reconstruction of the past through the study of language, comparative cultural value, and the effects on language and learning prompted by technology (in the form, for example, of the \u201cdigital humanities\u201d).   We will ask how comparative literature differs from other forms of literary study, but most of all concentrate on the low-tech (but not anti-technological) reading of literary texts \u2013 the student alone with a book in their hand -- while mastering as one\u2019s own a handful of the enduring classics of world literature \u2013 books that have influenced many generations of thinkers and writers but that, oddly, are not typically covered in any college curriculum: not in English classes, humanities introductions, or general knowledge courses.   Our focus will be on books that happen both to be central to Western and world culture as part of the inheritance of its educated citizens, but also that happen to be lost at the same time, known about rather than known, invoked but not studied, quoted from but not generally understood.   We will be addressing books, in other words, that deeply inspired, but also shaped the thinking of many of the scientists, artists, and scholars of the past, and which were once common knowledge \u2013 the expected points of departure for all educated men and women.   In our own day, their influence has hardly waned \u2013 although not in their original form.  Modern film and television industries, for instance, rely heavily on their stories, even as philosophers and theologians cannot express themselves without drawing on their characters, languages, and plots.  Even the basic elements of advertising would be unthinkable without being able to draw on their repertoire of common stories, mythological settings, and cast of heroes.  In an age of radical departures and brave new worlds, we are interested here in invaluable traditions, which have not lost their relevance.  ",

This course explores contemporary sub-Saharan African popular cinema, popular music, TV/radio series, bus slogans, community theatre, graphic narratives, fashion, sports, and other forms of popular communication as signifiers of larger social, political, and economic processes. It examines popular cultural forms as constantly evolving expressions of social, political, and personal identities in an ever globalized and interconnected world. As sites where the tensions, frictions, collisions and notably, the productive creativities of the local and the global are circulated, negotiated and contested African popular cultures provide insights into a unique and increasingly crucial facet of contemporary African artistic practice as critical intervention. Through our discussion of art and gender, we will examine the gendering of specific popular forms, their role in hegemonic formations, as well as their subversion in resistant practices and discourses.",

We will pursue an intensive study of primary readings written by Karl Marx himself, exploring the social, philosophical, and political history of Marxist thought and familiarizing ourselves with key concepts such as labor-power, primitive accumulation, the commodity, use value, exchange-value, surplus-value, crisis, money, and capital. As we study Marx as a theoretician, we will also examine his work as a political revolutionary, writer, and correspondent with many of the most important revolutionary figures of his day. Here we will foreground his analysis of the labor of enslaved Black persons in the plantation economies of the Southern United States\u2014which he ties to the labor markets of capitalism in Europe\u2014as well as his more explicit critiques of slavery and colonialism.\n\nFollowing this close reading of Marx and the Marxist tradition, we will consider the ways that critical thinkers and political activists, both in the United States and globally, continue to resist, create, and dream under the banner of Marxism throughout the twentieth century and into our own new century. We will center questions of racial justice through the writings of W. E. B. Du Bois and contemporary Marxist scholars of race, indigeneity, and diaspora, focusing on Du Bois\u2019s attention to the links between race and social class in America. Alongside critical reappraisals of Marx\u2019s thought, we shall think about the influence of Marx\u2019s writings on political activists in the Black Panther Party and the American Indian Movement, and on American labor, as well as on South American revolutionaries like Carlos Marighella. We will then move to a study of Marxist feminism, linking race and gender in U.S. and global Marxisms through readings by Black Panther activist and intellectual Angela Davis, the social historian Nancy Fraser, and Italian Marxist feminist Silvia Federici. We will revisit the question of gender oppression and feminist resistance through a Marxist frame, with reference to the revival of socialist prospects in the work of Jodi Dean and Mackenzie Wark. Finally, we will examine the contemporary fight over reproductive rights and the history of the \u201cWages for Housework\u201d movement.\nFrom these readings and conversations we will think about how Marx\u2019s ideas and their larger legacy can help us to understand our current moment and our political, social, and ecological futures. In as much as this is a course on theoretical perspectives, it will also be one that seeks to use Marx, and the Marxist tradition, to develop critical perspectives and solutions to pressing issues of racial injustice, social inequality, and environmental devastation.",

This is in part because Freud\u2019s writings were not restricted to the domain of psychology. His writings also renewed grand philosophical questions in ways that dramatically transformed them. He asked: What is a human subject? What are the causes of her actions? What are the nature and motivations of her engagement with others? In the many decades since his early publications, Freud\u2019s key concepts like the ego, the superego, the id, the unconscious, and the significance of dreams and jokes have had an enduring influence in Western culture. This course introduces students to a range of psychoanalytic writings from Freud\u2019s early theories of mental structure and human development to contemporary applications, re-workings, and critiques of psychoanalysis. We will discuss concepts like the unconscious, sexuality, disavowal, repression, neurosis, melancholia, the pleasure principle and the death drive. By the end of the course, we will have developed a sense of the uses and limitations of psychoanalysis for understanding pressing global issues such as sexual identification and its formation, racism, neo-fascism, extreme political division, war and nationalism, climate change, and the destruction of democratic ideals. Authors read may include Melanie Klein, Franz Fanon, Jacques Lacan, Julia Kristeva, David Eng, Slavoj Zizek, Henry Stack Sullivan, Kalpana Sheshadri- Crooks and Margaret Mahler. Readings will be complemented with short stories, literary excerpts, film clips, as well as discussion of current political issues.",

    "info": "This course introduces students to influential thinkers in the field of critical theory, broadly conceived. Critical theory is similar to philosophy because it asks big questions that stretch the boundaries of human knowledge. But it is distinct in its focus on practical change\u2014critical theory advocates for a more just and emancipated human world. Its key techniques are the diagnosis and critique of histories, systems, and ideologies of social power. Critical theory emerged from a group of Marxist intellectuals in the 1920s and 30s who were concerned about the rise of fascism, the staggering inequalities produced by industrial capitalism, the trauma of mass violence, and the numbing standardization of modern life. Since then, the field has expanded to encompass concerns about structural racism, gender inequality, the rise of neoliberalism, the expansion of modern carceral and mental health systems, and the ongoing inequities wrought by histories of slavery, colonization, and imperial conquest. Featured authors may include Sigmund Freud, W. E. B. Du Bois, Georg Simmel, Walter Benjamin, Max Horkheimer, Theodor Adorno, Frantz Fanon, Herbert Marcuse, Patricia Hill Collins, Malcom X, Jackie Wang, Angela Y.

    "info": "CSCL students who would like to pursue paid or unpaid internships can also earn credit toward their degree. This course includes a series of reflective assignments on the internship experience that help students develop their career goals, aspirations, and plans. CSCL students often find internships at media companies, advertising agencies, film festivals, arts institutions and galleries, publishing houses, non-profits, and community organizations. Typically a student\u2019s work is supervised and evaluated by a site coordinator and the instructor works with a student on readings and assignments. Credits taken are determined by the number of weekly or total hours for onsite internship work, course readings, assignments, and meetings. The following are minimum hours and weekly averages based on a 16 week semester: 1 credit - 45-hour minimum (average 3-4 hours per week) 2 credit - 90-hour minimum (average 5-7 hours per week) 3 credit - 135-hour minimum (average 8-9 hours per week) 4 credit - 180-hour minimum (average 10-12 hours per week) There is also a deferred enrollment section of the course that allows students to take a summer internship followed by fall enrollment for credit. Students interested or registered in this section must contact the instructor at the start of their internship or during registration for more information. Students are also encouraged to apply for CLA Internship and Leadership Scholarships. For more information on this course or internship possibilities, please contact the Film Studies Coordinator (stou0046@umn.edu). Students can also use Goldpass to search for internship possibilities.",

This course introduces students to key works of avant-garde and experimental film made by artists working on the margins of commercial film and mainstream art institutions. From the first half of the twentieth century, we will consider influential films made under the banners of Futurism, Constructivism, Surrealism, and Dada, and discuss their complex relation to Hollywood commodities. In the postwar period, we will explore a range of increasingly global experimental film practices, from the queer underground cinema in Latin America to the use of film projection in avant-garde performance. We will examine these practices in light of larger debates about medium specificity as well as the aesthetics and politics of the personal vs. the structural. In the final unit, we will reflect on the way contemporary artists, scholars, and curators have assembled a tradition of avant-garde cinema in the age of new media, and contemplate new directions we want it to take.",
