    "info": "What does it mean to be human? This question, central to the discipline of anthropology, has provided inspiration to scientists, philosophers, and artists for many centuries. In this course, we will begin to answer this question using the scientific study of the biological and cultural evolution of the human lineage. The first half of the term will introduce you to basic concepts in evolutionary theory: natural selection, genetics, behavioral ecology, and comparative anatomy. Using these tools, we will then spend the rest of the semester reconstructing the ecology, diet, anatomy, and behavior of our early ancestors, from the first apes to walk on two legs to the modern humans that conquered the globe. Weekly readings and lectures will provide the theoretical framework for understanding the evolutionary biology of Homo sapiens; laboratory sections will give you an opportunity to apply these theories and evaluate the fossil evidence for yourself. Through this combined approach, we will tackle such important questions as: What features define the human lineage? In what ecological setting did our ancestors become bipedal? What role did global climate change play in our evolution? How did tool use and cultural evolution feedback into our biological evolution? When and where did modern humans originate and what behaviors characterized this emergence? Why were there many species of humans in the past but only one today? Why is it important for the future of humanity for the average citizen to understand the principles of evolution as applied to the human animal? Upon completion of this course, you will have a broad knowledge of the role biological anthropology plays within the discipline of anthropology. More importantly, however, you will acquire a better understanding of the biological heritage of our species and our place among other forms of life on our planet.",

This course is an introduction to Asian American Studies, an interdisciplinary field that uses ethnography, literature, histories, films, memoirs, and other texts to study how the history of Asian immigration to the United States has visibly shaped existing Asian American communities and identities, and how \u201cAsian America\u201d is central to a more general understanding of American popular culture and public life.\n\nThe course is roughly organized chronologically. We will first begin with an introduction to the field of Asian American Studies by asking the questions: What is Asian America? What is Asian American Studies? We will then examine important concepts, categories, and processes before exploring the rich history of Asian migration to the United States and contemporary issues facing Asian Americans today.\n\nOne of the core principles of this course is to encourage active and interdisciplinary learning. This means that we will be learning in a variety of ways to explore and understand the material (reading, writing, watching, listening, seeing, discussing, presenting). We will be drawing from a wide range of disciplines (history, law, sociology, education, cultural studies, psychology, etc.). And we will be using a variety of materials (memoir, scholarly articles, historical documents, government records, newspapers, films, photographs, popular culture, etc.) Your active participation in these activities is essential.",

Though we cannot go back in time, human experiences of time are not linear or straightforward: memory, prediction, nostalgia, boredom, and regret on the one hand and myth, fantasy, hope, and science fiction on the other, pull us back and forth across time lines and scales. Physicists tell us that time is relative, that it is not a thing or a happening, that it may simply be our name for a structure we cannot comprehend. Meanwhile, in the historical time of Earth, different cultural traditions have experienced, explained, and used time in radically different ways. Moreover, as Europeans colonized the globe, encounters between different kinds of time have produced political effects that remain at the center of conflict, exchange, and inequalities. This course takes an anthropological perspective on time, drawing additionally on readings from history and geography to explore why it is we find time so very troublesome.",

This music continues to shape popular music today, and it continues to be a focus of cinematic attention. In this seminar we will focus on three sets of issues. First, we will consider the music in terms of the historical contexts that shaped it. Second, we will consider the question of how popular cinema and documentary films interpret (in sometimes problematic ways) this music, and what the politics of those representations might be. Third, we will attempt to understand musical genres and the movies in which they are featured in relation to the production of race, class and gender, and the experience of inequality in the United States.",

Have white Americans achieved its promise of freedom and prosperity at the expense of others? Or, has the dream been perverted by the exclusion of Black, Indigenous and People of Color to what Martin Luther King described as ?a lonely island of poverty in the midst of a vast ocean of material prosperity?? Moreover, to what extent have Americans resisted their exclusion or the exclusion of others from the promise of the Dream? Given that in the contemporary moment, inequality in the US has surpassed that of the Great Depression, what do these fractures and contestations in the American Dream mean for a larger society experiencing rampant precarity writ large? This pair of seminars (ANTH 1917 and HIST 1917) explores these questions in dialogue, occasionally meeting together and with a larger group of seminars connected to the College of Liberal Arts?s ?Living and Learning in the Land of 10,000 Perspectives? Civic Readiness Initiative. We believe that this cross-fertilization is critical because the fault-lines of inequality have precisely cohered to these structural formations and categories of analysis, i.e. race and racism. Moreover, an interdisciplinary approach (through anthropology and history) is crucial for examining the contested nature, historical contexts, and contemporary investments of the American Dream.",

Widely dispersed populations tend to differentiate through the process of adaptation to local environments and the accumulation of random genetic changes. However, complex patterns of gene exchange and culturally-mitigated migration can overwrite endemic variation, keeping our species genetically integrated and leaving traces of the prehistoric spread of populations around the world. We explore what it means to be human by examining the diversity of biological adaptations within our species. What features are unique to certain populations? What features unite us as a species? We will also work through the complex issues related to concepts of human race, and discuss the biological underpinnings of human variation.",

While the course is not designed to cover the literary criticism of SF literature nor the social analysis of the SF community of readers and authors, the choice of which SF authors to oppose to select anthropological topics was shaped by my understanding of the historical development of SF literature. Students will thus read stories written from the Golden Age of magazine SF to the most recent post-cyberpunk novelists.

It includes not only hands-on learning of specific analytical techniques, such as faunal and lithic analysis as well as site survey and excavation strategies, but also focuses on the theoretical approaches that guide the questions we ask and the methods we apply to answer them.  This class, therefore, prepares students for more upper-level classes in archaeology.  It also leads to a new way of thinking.  This way of thinking is primarily critical and analytical.  It leads one to think about how data are interpreted, and how theoretical frameworks as well as innate biases color these interpretations.  Seeking solutions to interpretive problems requires the creative application of multidisciplinary approaches.  Therefore, the study of archaeology leads to a new way of thinking about and doing science.",

While the course is not designed to cover the literary criticism of SF literature nor the social analysis of the SF community of readers and authors, the choice of which SF authors to oppose to select anthropological topics was shaped by my understanding of the historical development of SF literature. Students will thus read stories written from the Golden Age of magazine SF to the most recent post-cyberpunk novelists. The selection of SF stories is of course idiosyncratic but it is designed to reflect the goal of learning something of anthropology while having a blast reading SF.  \n",

Historical archaeology can be a very effective means to challenge some of the standard American narratives about our diverse past. Our aim is to move beyond either a simplistic ethnic pluralism or the superficial \u201cmelting pot\u201d progressive history and instead grapple with the materiality of settler colonialism, white supremacy, and capitalism.\n\nIn learning about this field, we will consider what has distinguished historical archaeology from American archaeology more broadly, and how those differences are parlayed into specific research strengths. This includes several themes: colonialism; the modern world and globalizing economies; intersectional identities (race and ethnicity, class, sex and gender, religion, age, ability/disability) and social movements; public memory and commemoration; landscapes and social space; citizenship and subjectivity. Although historical archaeology until recently has been restrictively defined as addressing the European-colonized New World, the discipline in the past twenty years has significantly broadened its scope and impact on the practice of archaeology as a whole. Throughout the course we will discuss these developments, and what directions archaeology may take in the future as a result. Course work includes both reading/discussion and learning methods through practical exercises, and handling of archaeological material.\n",

Although the music had deep roots in the American past, it also underwent dramatic transformations as a result of the coming of industrial capitalism to the south and as a result of the commercial recording process itself. This music continues to profoundly shape popular music today. We will try to consider as many questions as possible during the semester, but we will focus especially on three sets of issues. First, we will consider the music in terms of the historical contexts that shaped it. Second, we will consider the cultural politics surrounding the music as we focus on question of how historical narratives, popular media and popular perceptions, and scholarly works represent and interpret (in often problematic ways) certain genres of popular music and what the politics of those representations might be; and we will consider also how we listen to ?roots music,? how our listening is shaped by contemporary social and political circumstances. Third, we will attempt to understand musical genres in relation to the production of race and class and the experience of racial and class inequalities in the United States, and this may in turn prompt us to think critically about the idea of musical genre itself.",

The course uses multi-disciplinary resources to examine historical factors that have contributed to contemporary food security issues, and discusses grassroots food movements that embrace the ethics and values of African societies in their efforts to  achieve both food security and environmental sustainability. It also examines the interplay between  food security, indigenous knowledge, and environmental sustainability by comparing various  standpoints on African food production, scrutinizing the challenges the continent is facing and the unique perspectives it offers in terms of agricultural development in the globalized world. Finally, the  course examines how agricultural systems in Africa are affected by the new global land rush. After  taking the course, students will have better knowledge of emerging research directions on Africa and  will be equipped with sufficient research and practical skills to pursue independent studies beyond the  classroom.  \n",

As a consequence, variation within our species is both substantial and complex. On one hand, widely dispersed populations tend to differentiate through the process of adaptation to local environments and the accumulation of random genetic changes. On the other hand, complex patterns of gene exchange and culturally-mitigated migration can overwrite endemic variation, keeping our species genetically integrated and leaving traces of the prehistoric spread of populations around the world. Here, we will explore what it means to be human by examining the diversity of biological adaptations within our species. What features are unique to certain populations? What features unite us as a species? We will also work through the complex issues related to concepts of human race and discuss the biological underpinnings of human variation.",

It uncovers the social practices and behaviors that define urban life; urban-rural distinctions; the material and ecological processes that constitute cities; and popular representations of city and/or countryside. On the other hand, the course investigates the spatial and social divisions of the city, seeking to understand the historical struggles and ongoing processes that both draw together and differentiate the people of an urban environment. It studies how cities influence decision-making, contributing to the uneven distribution of power and resources. It considers: industrialization; urban class conflict; gendered and racialized spaces; and suburbanization. Both of these approaches will also critically consider the city as a social object that we encounter and learn about through our engagement with kinds of media, such as novels and film. Hence, reading for the class will include literature from the social sciences and humanities, as well as critical works of fiction.\n\nStudents will engege with these broader anthropological issues through an investigation of several global cities, especially Minneapolis-St. Paul, Chicago, Paris, Mexico City, Brasilia, and New Delhi. The class mixes lecture, discussion, and guided research. Lectures will introduce the history of urbanism and urban anthropology. Discussions will critically examine the readings, and offer insights and examples to better understand them. By participating in a guided research project, students will uncover hidden aspects of their own city, using ethnography or archaeology to shed light on the urban environment, social struggles over space, or other themes.",

It has four aims: l) to introduce the problem of nonWestern peoples in the West from historical points of view, 2) to discuss the relationship between mass media and issue of representation to the marketplace, 3) to introduce the concept of morality in and through collective representations as developed by Durkheim, and 4) to analyze the problem of moral agency in a series of Hollywood and Independent movies which portray nonwestern peoples and cultures. We will watch movies portraying three different groups of cultures, Pacific Islanders, Native Americans, and the Japanese. In each unit, we will first read important commentary on Western representations of each of these peoples, such as Bernard Smith on Pacific Islanders and Vine Deloria on images of Native Americans and Gina Marchetti on Hollywood\u2019s Japanese.",

The practice of warfare brings together a number of unusualcharacteristics of our species, including the ability to cooperate, to discuss plans, and to makeand use weapons, which together combine to create immense human suffering. War has longbeen a central topic of anthropologists, who have raised many questions. Is warfare a humanuniversal? Are there truly peaceful societies? Why does war occur more often at some times andplaces than others? How, when and why did warfare evolve? What, if anything, does warfarehave to do with intergroup aggression in other animals? What role has warfare, or its moreprimitive antecedents, played in the evolution of our species? Efforts to explain war havethemselves been contentious, with some scholars arguing that war is a recent phenomenonresulting from factors such the development of agriculture, and other scholars arguing that war isan evolutionarily ancient phenomenon with roots in the common ancestor of humans andchimpanzees. In this seminar, we will read and discuss classic and recent texts on this broad andoften divisive subject. To better assess the arguments presented in survey and theoretical papers,we will read original ethnographic materials, with each student choosing one subsistence societyas the focus of their research efforts.",

    "info": "Our subtitle is \u201csacredness.\u201d The operational presupposition of the class is that sacredness is more than a mental phenomenon: it involves objects and bodies. Modern perspectives on religion have long downplayed this \u201cmaterial\u201d aspect as they privileged iconoclastic spirituality. The anthropology of religion aims to go beyond the material/spiritual opposition and asks how rituals employ objects and bodies in order to capture the effect we might call spiritual or mystical. Intellectually, this is an extremely difficult wisdom for the moderns to grasp because the binary oppositions between the spiritual and the material, between mind and the body, subtend modern society\u2019s very sense of order and rationality. This class is successful if we can have even a glimpse of how much difficulty we moderns have in seeing beyond these binaries. \nTake, for example, sacrifice. It is almost intuitive that the human condition abides in the requisition of sacrifice: redemption is found by suffering, abundance secured by loss, and the gift of life enabled by death. Such an intuition is as universal as its practiced intent is ambiguous to us. Ambiguous because the following questions immediately rise: For whom or in whose \"eyes\" is a gesture of sacrificial offering supposed to be accounted for? If one facilitates one\u2019s own death in the hands of one\u2019s enemy in a redemptive gesture\u2014which is, arguably, the case of Jesus Christ\u2014would the enemy part of the redeemed? We will raise the most impenetrable of such questions through compelling examples in contemporary politics, such as the post-9/11 category of so-called religiously-motivated protest suicide. As Talal Asad argues, one of the reasons the \"suicide bombing\" is so disconcerting to us is not because of the extent of its violence\u2014which is not remarkable compared to technology-driven terror tactics\u2014but because the act violates our dearest binaries: victim/victimizer, dying/killing, means/ends, and crime/punishment. At the bottom of these binaries, as we will see in this class, is the binary opposition between materiality and spirituality. This issue will be expanded into modern society in the latter part of the class. \n\nThere are no prerequisites for this class. ",

The course draws on and combines perspectives from the four subdisciplines of anthropology (archaeological anthropology, bioarchaeological anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and sociocultural anthropology), and similar disciplines, to understand the varying ways that scholars have analyzed and defined ecologies and environmental problems. It places particular emphasis on theories that define human relationships to the environment as recursive and interdependent. These theories stand in contrast to common Western theological suppositions that see the environment as a framework to which human societies adapt or a set of resources for human communities to exploit. Rather, historical ecologists argue that the environment is a true ecology with humans in it. They contend that human communities are fundamentally and inextricably intertwined with the life cycles and needs of other species, and consequently they study how human-environmental interactions emerge through distinct historical processes and cultural circumstances.",

Historical archaeology can be a very effective means to challenge some of the standard American narratives about our diverse past. Our aim is to move beyond either a simplistic ethnic pluralism or the superficial \u201cmelting pot\u201d progressive history and instead grapple with the materiality of settler colonialism, white supremacy, and capitalism. In learning about this field, we will consider what has distinguished historical archaeology from American archaeology more broadly, and how those differences are parlayed into specific research strengths. This includes several themes: colonialism; the modern world and globalizing economies; intersectional identities (race and ethnicity, class, sex and gender, religion, age, ability/disability) and social movements; public memory and commemoration; landscapes and social space; citizenship and subjectivity. Although historical archaeology until recently has been restrictively defined as addressing the European-colonized New World, the discipline in the past twenty years has significantly broadened its scope and impact on the practice of archaeology as a whole. Throughout the course we will discuss these developments, and what directions archaeology may take in the future as a result. Course work includes both reading/discussion and learning methods through practical exercises, and handling of archaeological material.",

The course uses multi-disciplinary resources to examine historical factors that have contributed to contemporary food security issues, and discusses grassroots food movements that embrace the ethics and values of African societies in their efforts to  achieve both food security and environmental sustainability. It also examines the interplay between food security, indigenous knowledge, and environmental sustainability by comparing various standpoints on African food production, scrutinizing the challenges the continent is facing and the unique perspectives it offers in terms of agricultural development in the globalized world. Finally, the course examines how agricultural systems in Africa are affected by the new global land rush. After taking the course, students will have better knowledge of emerging research directions on Africa and will be equipped with sufficient research and practical skills to pursue independent studies beyond the classroom.

    "info": "This class explores anthropological approaches to urban life. On one hand, the course examines the ontological nature of the city by looking into the relation between cities and their environment, and asking whether and how people differentiate \"urban\" and \"non-urban\" spaces. It uncovers the social practices and behaviors that define urban life; urban-rural distinctions; the material and ecological processes that constitute cities; and popular representations of city and/or countryside. On the other hand, the course investigates the spatial and social divisions of the city, seeking to understand the historical struggles and ongoing processes that both draw together and differentiate the people of an urban environment. It studies how cities influence political decision-making, contributing to the uneven distribution of power and resources. It considers: industrialization; urban class conflict; gendered and racialized spaces; and suburbanization. Both of these approaches will also critically consider the city as a social object that we encounter and learn about through our engagement with kinds of media, such as novels and film. Hence, reading for the class will include literature from the social sciences and humanities, as well as critical works of fiction.\n\nStudents will engage with these broader anthropological issues through an investigation of several global cities, especially Minneapolis-St. Paul, Chicago, Paris, Mexico City, Brasilia, and New Delhi. The class mixes lecture, discussion, and guided research. Lectures will introduce the history of urbanism and urban anthropology. Discussions will critically evaluate the readings, and offer insights and examples to better understand them. By participating in a guided research project, students will uncover hidden aspects of their own city, using ethnography or archaeology to shed light on the urban environment, social struggles over space, or other themes.

    "info": "This graduate seminar examines how DNA is used to trace the evolutionary history of humans and our hominin relatives. We will examine how genetic evidence has informed understanding of human evolution, the peopling of the world, human adaptation, animal domestication, disease and health, forensics, and the embodiment of the lived experience. Students will review important concepts of molecular and population genetics and become familiar with current methodologies and datasets used in molecular anthropology\u2014including those used in fields paleogenomics and epigenetics research. Lastly, we will discuss how molecular anthropologists engage with the ethical issues posed by genetic technologies, especially as it pertains to research with Indigenous and underrepresented communities, discussions of race and identity, commercial genetic testing, and forensic genetic genealogy. Course discussions will highlight how genetic findings are integrated with other lines of evidence such as archaeology, cultural anthropology, and traditional knowledge sources, to reconstruct the complexity of the past and present human experience. Course meetings will be a mix of lecture, discussion sessions and practical data analysis training sessions. Students will be assessed based on participation in class discussions, in-class practical exercises, and a term paper representing a thorough literature review of a topic related to the course. ",

Students analyze different kinds of tool marks on bone, weathering, carnivore modifications, eco-morphology, ages of death, bone tools, and bones from archaeological sites to infer the \"life history\" of a bone.
