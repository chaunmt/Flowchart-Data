Rhetoric is an art form with a diverse theoretical landscape, meaning that there is no singular, stable definition of the term; rather, rhetoric is a practice that has been used as an organizing principle for a variety of communicative acts \u2013 written, spoken, and enacted. As such, the study of rhetorical theory and criticism begins with the understanding that human beings use language and symbols to shape our many worldviews. The skills obtained in this class will help you to understand the nature and function of the persuasive strategies that structure our everyday lives and arguments.
