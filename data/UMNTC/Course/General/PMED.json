This innovative elective is centered on learner engagement, simulation of clinical experiences, and the importance of building relationships with faculty and residents.  Medical students will participate in telehealth appointments with faculty and virtually follow standardized patients from consultation to discharge building their own plan of care and walking through that plan with senior residents that have a distinct set of learning objectives in place.  Medical students will participate in interactive journal clubs, lectures, and didactic education with faculty and residents via Zoom on a daily basis.  Virtual office hours with faculty and residents will provide students an opportunity to learn more about the field, the varied education and career paths taken, and to build meaningful relationships within the Department.  To supplement the live education, an entire library of video presentations was built by Department faculty and affiliate faculty across the Twin Cities. This ensures students always have access to foundational material as well as the opportunity to delve deeper into their unique areas of interest. This virtual curriculum provides students a quality, robust, learning experience that serves as a great introduction to the field of Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation. ",
