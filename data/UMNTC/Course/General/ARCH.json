The beauty and power of light and shadow inspires the work of the greatest architectural masters. This BDA Workshop explores the many roles of daylighting in architectural design and how it is shaped by the intersection of both poetic and performance goals and aspirations.  A select group of exquisite rooms of leading modern and contemporary architects will be compared and contrasted to gain insight into larger luminous design concepts, principles, strategies, and lessons on the art of daylighting design. Physical and computer models, photography, rendered drawings, diagramming, and computer analysis will be explored to understand the daylighting design philosophies, strategies, and details of 'Masters of Light' and the application of daylighting design lessons to an individual daylight investigation. Learning objectives are: to compare and contrast poetic and performance daylighting design concepts, principles, and strategies of modern and contemporary masters; to develop a comparative knowledge of daylighting theories and practices from case studies of exquisite rooms to gain the knowledge and skills necessary to effectively develop and assess qualitative and quantitative daylighting strategies; and to develop a personal daylighting design theory, process, and practice.\n",

Coursework is focused on advancing practice-based and use-inspired applied research which builds upon robust literature review, case-based knowledge, evidence-based design, and performance-based outcomes for the built environment industry. The course work is structured to identify and develop practice-engaged emerging research questions, conduct and implement research design, disseminate best practices, case studies, design frameworks, and strategies to drive innovation, ensure quality, and create value for the profession of architecture which will maximize positive environmental, social, and economic impacts. \n\nThis course is specifically related to internship experience in a local or regional context to study larger emerging practice-related issues in the Research Practices Consortium. Students have access to professional firms in the Research Practices Consortium. Research Practices Internships are based on research priorities set by the Consortium, particular member firm, student intern, and faculty advisors. Additional firms (national and international as appropriate) outside the region may be used as comparators. Students are asked to form research networks in academia and practice. In this course, students position research as Practice knowledge based on topics in the Research Practices internships.\n\nIn this 1 credit course, the themes are addressed in graphic and text representation are described below. Visual methods of data collection, analysis and representation along with diagramming concepts and information graphics are essential to understanding and explaining critical issues in a research implementation and/or case study in the built environment fields. The format of information can be designed to emphasize comparisons between data sets or projects or to highlight unique characteristics of research finding or  individual projects. This course will explore a variety of strategies commonly used in built environment practices and ask the student to apply one method to present the research and/or case developed in the Research Practices Internship. Additionally, this course relates the research definition completed in the Research Practices internship to Practice by conceptualizing and diagramming related case studies and/or examining, critiquing current methods of practice, and proposing future methods of practice in response to the research.\n",
