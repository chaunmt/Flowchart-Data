    "info": "To understand Anne Frank's symbolic status as a holocaust victim and object of identification for many young people in the world, one must know the context of her ethnic heritage, the uniqueness of her hiding situation, and the critical acclaim of her journal and its adaptations. This seminar examines the iconic text against the backdrop of the Netherlands under a civil administration during the Nazi occupation. From the perspective of the history of Jewish life in the Netherlands, the rise of antisemitism and the German exploitation of the Dutch bureaucracy for the purpose of persecution and deportation, Anne Frank will emerge as a particular case of victimization, one of many, and not as the universal example with sainthood status that she has become over time. To look at her from this perspective, however, will by no means undermine or devalue the legacy of her optimism and humanism for our world of today.",

    "info": "In the 17th century, Amsterdam was the richest city in the world. From here, the Dutch East India Company, the first multinational corporation of its kind, sailed across the oceans to establish trading posts and colonies all over the globe. Here, they speculated with tulips at the world\u2019s oldest stock market. 17th-century Amsterdam was known for its financial prosperity as well as its religious and intellectual freedom. Exiled communities settled here and enriched the city with new philosophies, religious ideas, and innovative scientific and technical practices. Amsterdam is the city of famous architects and painters, musicians, radical thinkers, and writers. While the wealth of Amsterdam was acquired through a vast global trading network, it did include traffic in enslaved people throughout its colonial empire. The course will explore current debates surrounding the Dutch colonial legacy in a 21st-century multicultural world and Amsterdam\u2019s leading role in our reconciliation with the past.",
