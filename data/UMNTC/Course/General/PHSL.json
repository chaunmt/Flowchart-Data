Ever curious about what your brain looks like compared to someone with Alzheimer's? If your answer is yes, then this class is for you! This entirely human-based course is designed to tap into the curiosities we all have about our bodies by providing you with a foundational understanding of how your body works. The goal of this course is for you to learn about the human body and how it functions when it is both healthy and when things break down. In the classroom setting, we will focus on understanding the functions of each major organ system from the heart to the brain. Then in the lab, each of you will have the opportunity to see and touch real human organs you just learned about in class. Additionally, in this course, you will compare both healthy and diseased human tissue to better understand how choices you make every day can affect your organ's structure and function. When you leave this course, you will leave empowered, not only by your understanding of your own physiology, but by your ability to evaluate and understand the science you will continue to hear about and see in the media.",

During lecture, we will focus on understanding the functions of each major organ system from the heart to the brain. Then in the lab, we will build on what you have learned by applying the content to actual human cadaveric material. Students will be asked to observe and document changes in structure of diseased organs and hypothesize how these changes would have affected the function of this organ in a human body. Additionally, the discussion portion of the class will focus on specific pathology as it relates to the organ systems you learned about in lecture and lab. These discussions will challenge students to think critically about disease mechanisms by studying primary literature and by diving into well understood mechanisms that highlight powerful physiology. The goal of this course is to provide students a strong foundation in physiology and the important role each organ system plays in maintaining homeostasis within the body.",

While studying each system we will start with the normal physiology and transition to predicting how these systems break down under diseased conditions.  This active learning class will be broken up in to mini-lectures and small group discussion.  Each mini lecture will include an introduction to the current system and will be followed by a group discussion where you will be asked to predict, illustrate, articulate, and summarize the normal physiology and the changes that occur in the face of outside stressors.   You will see that some physiological changes occur rapidly, and some over many years.  Moreover, some changes are physiological while others pathological.

However, observational studies and laboratory research indicate that inflammation is an important common causative factor in several chronic diseases and their comorbidities. In this course, we will explore the latest developments in the field of inflammation-mediated chronic diseases. The students will learn about the mechanisms by which non-infectious inflammatory processes mediate chronic disease. First, we will review basic concepts of innate and adaptive immune responses including the role of immune cells, recognition and signaling mechanisms, and inflammatory cytokines. We will learn basic concepts of immunity and inflammation followed by a discussion of how inflammation is a central mechanism of chronic diseases including diabetes (type I and II), atherosclerosis, heart failure, fatty liver disease, and hypertension. The inflammatory diseases that we will cover will include a short patient-case study. We will study technical advances in the fight against disease and explore future directions for new treatments involving immunotherapy or anti-inflammatory strategies. Courses in physiology, such as PHSL3051, 3061, and Microbiology and Immunology, such as MICB 4131 and MICB 8003, are recommended but not required.",
