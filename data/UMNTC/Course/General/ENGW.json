For centuries an historic, scholarly, and artistic center, Toledo was long famed for its religious tolerance, with Christian, Jewish, and Muslim populations coexisting within its walls. Class will begin in Minnesota with writing experiments, readings, and discussions: why do we travel and what do we gain from a journey into the unfamiliar? How have travelers past and present reacted to cultures and environments not their own? In preparation for spring break in Spain, students will respond to a variety of writing prompts and assignments: the travel memory, the food review, the creative tour guide, the work of ekphrasis, the annotated map, etc. Then, on arrival in Toledo, students will wander through tangled streets, cathedrals, fortresses, synagogues, and museums, keeping a detailed travel journal and taking notes for a final essay as they go. We'll benefit from guided tours of Spanish monuments and museums and take day trips to Madrid and to Segovia. Writing and revising will be emphasized throughout the semester as modes of discovery.

These varied writing assignments will allow students to develop the core writing skills of brainstorming, drafting, and revising as well as communicating ideas in different modes for different audiences. Useful for writers, science students, and those engaged with environment issues, and curious adventurers, the class begins after spring break and extends into May with a two-week immersion experience in New Zealand.An island nation of fiords and volcanoes that has followed a unique evolutionary path, New Zealand is the ideal place to read and write about the natural world. Populated by flightless birds and outsize insects, it has no native land mammals except bats. The country, also called Aotearoa, \"The Land of the Long White Cloud,\" is at the forefront of many scientific debates and challenges, including evolution on islands, the impacts and control of native species, climate change, and reintroduction biology. We will explore Wellington, the capital city, as well as Dunedin, the \"Wildlife Capital of New Zealand,\" a city rich in Maori and Scottish heritage, Victorian architecture, and literary tradition. We will meet with scientists and conservationists working on issues that face both New Zealand and the entire planet. In addition, we will take trips to Matui/Somes Island, a predator-free scientific reserve, the Museum of New Zealand (Te Papa Tongarewa), and the Otago Peninsula, home of colonies of little blue penguins and royal albatross.",

    "info": "This course combines a survey course with close readings to help students become more informed readers of key writers who have shaped long form journalism's traditions in Britain and the United States. Most of the course will focus on the 20th century, although we will consider key innovations from the 18th and 19th centuries; students will apply what they learn to a final project that examines a 21st century writer\u2019s texts and contexts. The works in this course focus on what some have called \u201cliterary journalism,\u201d which uses the tools of fiction\u2014character and scenes, tropes, and varying points of view\u2014to tell stories that are reported and true (in other words, that are verified and not invented). To understand the power of this work, and the dilemmas it presents, we\u2019ll consider its common origin in both journalism and the novel in the 18th century and track its development through British and American writers as they told ground-level stories about London's poor, America's 19th century urban overcrowding, city streets, the inhumanity of nuclear war, the vulnerability of celebrities, political identity, the depths of artistic self-doubt, drug subcultures of the sixties, the geological fate of huge metropolitan areas and the racism at the heart of American life during civil rights era. We'll also ask critical questions about the conventions and ethics of doing this work, considering the sometimes-compromising role of journalist-confidant as well as the privilege of powerful publishing platforms to exclude diverse voices. By understanding how so-called literary journalism has endured or evolved, students are better able to appreciate the contributions of longform journalists today as they navigate the truths and fictions of today.",
