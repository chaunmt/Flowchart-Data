This course is taught by a law professor who has spent his career litigating wrongful conviction cases and directing the California Innocence Project. It is designed to provide students with an overview of the issues and case law related to wrongful convictions through the use of interactive exercises, lectures, readings, videos, and case studies.",

There will then be opportunities to compare it to the American system and to other learning communities in the world to better understand how they reflect and perpetuate the cultural values and identity of a country. Students will explore current educational issues from an intercultural perspective and develop their own informed views. At the end of the course, students are expected to have acquired a basic knowledge and understanding about the structure and content of contemporary school systems and a capacity to use this knowledge for cross-national comparisons. The insights gained will allow students to consider a key question: how can we all contribute to the school of the future? This course is designed as a CAPA Globally Networked Programme (GNL) connecting CAPA students in different study locations in order to examine issues from a transnational perspective. It will provide a unique opportunity to broaden critical understanding of the school system role in the identity building process at an individual, social, political, and national level. Through collaborative and comparative learning processes in both local environments and transnational communities, students will develop a deeper understanding of the school system role in shaping values, societies, and cultures.",

Throughout, we will be attentive both to the literary qualities of writings about the environment and to their historical and political contexts. We will be studying a range of genres, including poetry, fiction, nonfiction, websites and photographic texts. The course will be organized chronologically, with units on key ideas in the study of literature in relation to the environment: pastoral, wilderness, pollution, apocalypse, and ecosystems. Since the course will be set in London, we will also consider the design and representation of \u201curban nature,\u201d including parks, gardens, zoos, riverbanks, and art exhibits.

Key topics to be explored will include the arts as a business; managing financial imperatives and the artistic process; promoting and presenting cultural products. Case studies will be drawn from a variety of fields such as film, digital media, gaming, theatre, museums, and publishing, and students will have the opportunity to engage directly with practitioners successfully working in various fields of arts and culture and those managing the interface between creativity and business in London. It is an industry that is growing year on year, but it can be a difficult market to navigate and capture economical value, as \"cultural goods\" are less fixed, or less concrete than other measurable areas of ex-change.\n\nStudents will examine the history of the Creative Industries to understand the current environment in an historical context. They will focus specifically on the shifting creative industries in a digital world with the advent of social media, streaming services, revolutionary marketing techniques, crowd-sourcing, and audience creation. Students will explore key concepts and theories, but they will also explore the practical applications of the industries in action. They will gain a deeper understanding of the media they consume via interaction with professionals, venues, and event opportunities highlighted in this module.  Throughout this course, students will be encouraged to explore their own interests of the Creative Industries. By bringing personal experience and interest into an analytical environment, this module will allow students to gain a deeper understanding of media artifacts, and provide them with the tools and skills to expand their understanding and engagement with their chosen sectors.",

    "info": "In the early twenty-first century, museums are becoming increasingly more relevant to all parts of society, exhibition displays are often controversial and politically charged. This course is an introduction to both British society, culture and museology. The course considers museums as reflections of the British psyche, unique cultural constructs that help us understand \"Britishness\". We will also be looking at museums as institutions of \"global\" heritage in the context of a global city, with a unique British perspective. As an introduction to museology, the course will look at the development of the modern museum and its operation, as well as interrogate the different types of museums. We will look at the impact British history, society and politics have had on London museums, their creation and their day to day operations and audiences. Taking advantage of our location, we will do field work in eight different museums, from the famous and vast \"global\" British Museum to the small and privately-owned Saatchi Gallery.\n\nStudents will analyze the ways in which imperialism and its legacy, as well as Britain's global relationships have influenced museum development and how this gives rise to the politics of patrimony. We will look at questions of cultural appropriation and the political debate on repatriation versus protection. This debate has recently been energized by the depredations of IS on what many would call the global heritage of Iraq and Syria. We will also be looking at material culture and what it says about individuals and society. Students will examine the choices, ethics and political and social meanings of both creating material culture and collecting it, and the ethics of preservation and restoration. While the creation of material culture has specific psychological, social and often political meanings; collecting, preserving and displaying one particular object involves a very complex decision-making process which is influenced by the cultural values of the decision maker.  We will examine, for example, the impact of the Classical period on British society in the past and present, its importance to class and education in Britain, and how this is reflected in museum collections. Students will also look at the complex decision making of conservators and restorers. These decisions have social and political impact, choosing to emphasize one period and use over another. The course will also look closely at decision makers and their role in the museum industry, the origins of museums from individuals to trade exhibitions and current museum professionals, as well as the impact museum audiences have on the work of museums. Students will also examine the impact of communities on museum development, on exhibition creation, how engaged museums are with their communities, and how the unique diversity of London is reflected (or not) in its museums.",

The pressures of globalization, aging populations, increasing patient demands and the rising costs of research and medical treatments are forcing us to look more critically at how healthcare is delivered to devise changes for the future. Changes made to health systems are often based on economic and political rationale and with many countries currently experiencing significant changes to the way in which health care systems have historically been funded and delivered. \n\nThis course will introduce students to the healthcare system in the UK and the context within which it operates. It will start by looking at the introduction of the National Health System (NHS) in 1948 and take students through the key changes that have taken place right up to the present day. Drawing on a series of cases studies, students will be able to compare the UK model of healthcare with other healthcare systems such as in the USA, France, Sweden and/or from low and middle-income countries. \n\nStudents will explore a range of key concepts and themes in comparative healthcare from a multidisciplinary perspective. They will also develop critical appraisal skills to assess the quality of evidence used to support developments in healthcare policy and practice and help students to look critically at the role that governmental and non-governmental organizations play in healthcare. \n\nThroughout this course, special attention will be paid to comparisons between the UK, USA and low and middle-income countries to allow students to directly relate their learning to their own educational and healthcare setting and contrasting health systems worldwide. Emphasis will be placed on the multiple factors that determine health at the individual and population levels. By comparing patterns of health across different demographic groups, immigration status and so on, students will explore a range of different intersections to expand their understanding of impacts of health inequalities on different populations, and how different countries have sought to address these inequalities.\n",

The city, in particular its interwar technologies of urban transport and machinery, provided the ideal testing ground for the newly sensitive and mobile camera. It demanded to be seen, and shown, in a new mode that for Brazilian director Alberto Cavalcanti, only film could provide. \n\nThe city has been an integral part of the filmmaker\u2019s vocabulary since cinema\u2019s genesis in the late 19th Century. The urban environment and the craft of film grew up together in the 20th Century. This course takes examples of city films from throughout that century and encourages you to investigate the urban contexts and subjectivities explored therein. ",

    "info": "The 21st Century is witnessing a remarkable resurgence of feminism around the globe. In London, the annual Women\u2019s March unites feminists from across the UK and internationally, highlighting the dynamic nature of their voices and campaigns. Such events pay homage to the women\u2019s suffrage demonstrations in the city a hundred years earlier, not only reinforcing the connections between historical and contemporary campaigns for gender equality, but also revealing the diversification and progression of feminism. Throughout London\u2019s history, feminists of various classes, races, nationalities, and cultural backgrounds have utilized the city as a space, physical and imaginary, to devise and implement their ideas through a series of campaigns, crusades, and political movements. This course investigates the relationship between feminism and London: how feminists drew their inspiration from its slums, alleyways, and workplaces; its markets and marketplaces; its domestic spaces; its artistic hubs; and its private members-only clubs. Focusing on the period from the mid-18th Century to the present, it examines both individual activists and writers as diverse as Mary Wollstonecraft, Annie Besant, Olive Morris, and Bernadine Evaristo, as well as collective campaigns around issues such as workers\u2019 rights, birth control, and racial discrimination to chart the ways in which feminists appropriated the terrain of urban space to advance their appeals for equality. Topics we will explore include: women\u2019s writing, sexuality, consumerism, class dynamics, campaigns for political rights and representation, fashion and style, imperialism and its legacies, feminism and popular culture, Black & Asian feminisms, and the impact of social media upon feminist activism and discourse.",

    "info": "Broadly this class focuses on how media are used to facilitate and sustain exploitative political and economic practices\u2014e.g., how media helped facilitate imperialism and, dialectically, how media have been used by individuals and groups to contest or speak back to power. Our focus traverses history but increasingly comes to focus on the present moment, which is characterized by rapid changes in media practices such as the relatively recent emergence of social media and complexly related transformations in political and economic practices and systems (e.g., the election of Donald Trump, the \u201cBrexit\u201d referendum, the rise of new forms of \u201cpopular\u201d nationalism, and new practices of propaganda). This course focuses more closely on these contemporary transformations as they happen in front of our eyes with bewildering pace. Our goals are to foster interesting explorations and conversations about media and our political and economic realities. Our (expansive) goals are to understand the role film and media plays in the orchestration of power, and how this has been contested and transformed. The film material and scholarship will also enable us to learn about political struggles mostly occluded in mainstream corporate media. \n\t\nIn the midst of these broad agendas, the class pursues some pragmatic objectives: it will expand knowledge of cinema history, including different histories of production, distribution, and exhibition. (We understand \u201ccinema\u201d here broadly to refer to the production and dissemination of moving pictures, and cinema to be a form of mass media that is inherently inter-medial.) It will explore different forms of this cinema (documentary, experimental, propagandistic, fictional) and lead us to examine the politics of form across history. It will explore the writings of cultural activists and academics as they examine questions about media, power, and influence. It will produce knowledge about past political struggles as mediated through film (and push us to learn about the socio-political contexts in which the films were made and circulated). Plus it will necessarily prompt questions about how different state systems engage with media and how the production and regulation of media are political acts that shape the possible public sphere. In pursuing these lines of enquiry our work will necessarily be interdisciplinary, and we will draw in particular (but not exclusively) from scholarship in political history and political science, public policy, film, media, and cultural studies, history, and broadly progressive traditions of historical, cultural, and media analysis. The class contributes to larger curricular goals in various ways: It explores the international history of cinema, in its political contexts in particular, draws on concepts across the humanities and social science of use to the study of cinema, and it will encourage and foster the production of scholarly work that clearly and coherently addresses issues important to the study of cinema and the modern world.

We combine practical exercises in filming and editing with a close look at the tradition of the essay film, and a consideration of how the essayistic might also infuse contemporary screen culture. By closely integrating practical elements with theoretical sessions, we hope to draw connections between the discourse on urban consumer society and the images surrounding it, between collecting objects and editing, between the order of things and creating a political narrative. \n\nYou will be asked to gather \u201cfragments\u201d\u2014one or several shots and/or audio recordings\u2014in response to themes. The fragments will be uploaded to a dedicated video blog and reviewed by the whole group at different points during the term. We aim to build a habit of constructive criticism so that you are comfortable sharing work-in-progress and improving it. You will then move on to planning and producing your essay film, with a number of deadlines built in for footage reviews and rough-cut screenings to ensure progress and development. \n\nYour essay films will be screened for a final assessment with all faculty in the last session of term. The final assessment is a critical text documenting the experience of making, refining, and screening the film, so that you can reflect on your process.\n",

This course aims to explore the deep funds of strangeness and otherness that permeate London\u2019s places and spaces, through examining films and television series that show the city as a brimming reservoir of past and future shocks.\n\nThe course will examine science fiction, horror, and noir/neo-gothic cinema and television from all eras, with a particular emphasis on works that take London itself as a major part of their story. These might be disaster or alien invasion films that see the city as a site of destruction or devastation, horror films which render a familiar city frightening and strange, or noir explorations of London\u2019s underbelly that expose sides of the city that are normally hidden.\n\nThe course will both present an alternative history of London on film and provide you with rich possibilities for the analytic study of film and television. Horror and science fiction are notorious as vessels for the expression of both social and political anxieties, and the selection of films would encourage analyses of both psychological content and broader contexts (areas might include, for instance, Cold War-era fears, body horror, racial or class concerns).\n\nReadings will be both critical and complementary, and hope to locate uncanny London on film in relation not only to American cinematic tropes in genres such as horror, but also to the large fictional and occult literature which features London as a place of archaic energies and occult forces.\n\nAll students develop their basic skills in analyzing film texts and will also develop a good grasp of long-trends and recent themes in British horror and science fiction cinema. You will gain insight into the ways that film can reflect and respond to contemporary social and political conditions and events, and the way that film and television relate to literature. You will gain an understanding of horror and science fiction as key genres in British film, and gain awareness of some key points at which these genres in British cinema and television differ from their counterparts in US film.",

Is human nature noble, but enchained by corrupted institutions or is it brutish and violent, requiring a social contract with an authority to safeguard the rights of all? If we accept the second proposition, who guards the guards?\n\nThe tensions between national and supra-national governance, exemplified by the US withdrawal from the World Health Organisation, appear to echo the trend to increasing nationalism, autonomy and populism that influenced the UK decision on Brexit (Britain exiting the European Union). The organic and viral movement of activism in support of Black Lives Matter may share some of the characteristics of Extinction Rebellion inasmuch as the concerns for immediate action on racial injustice, the climate crisis, and other issues, have seen large numbers of people, including a significant proportion of the youth demographic, take to the streets, and mobilise for direct action for social change.\n\nThis course will explore historic, recent, and contemporary trends in the political authority invested in the nation-state and its agencies and contrast this with social and political forces expressing discontent with the status quo. One section of the syllabus will examine ideas for greater global governance, such as the League of Nations, the UN, and new bodies such as the International Criminal Court. The second section of the syllabus will explore ideas for local autonomy, and radical action on such matters as policing, systemic racism, carbon consumption, the rising use of surveillance technology, and the free-market assumptions that underpin Western societies. Other modules in the course will examine the phenomenon that has been labelled \u201cpopulism\u201d and the discontent with current form of globalization, both from the political right and the political left. A further module will explore the fragmentation of the West-centric global order in light of an increasing multipolar world and the rising economic and political dynamism of China.\n",

The latest wave of criticism began with the rash of scandals first brought to light in late 2001, when the Enron fraud was exposed: the Enron debacle was an ethical tsunami that redefined business\u2019s relationships with society and the global community. Since then, other corporate names have been publicly shamed: Martha Stewart, Rite Aid, ImClone, HealthSouth, WorldCom, Global Crossing, Microsoft, Monsanto, Wal-Mart, Facebook, Tyco, Adelphia, Boeing, and many others. The global economic crisis that began in 2008 has added also banks, financial operators, and insurances to the list of ethically controversial business actors. In general, companies must today grapple with highly complex and vast societal concerns that far exceed the pursuit of a satisfactory bottom line\u2014and do so in a globalized, highly interconnected, instantly informed, and socially conscious environment.\n\nWe will discuss the role of business in society, and whether business without ethics can be sustained in a world characterized by great economic uncertainty, financial insecurity, dramatic levels of inequality both within and among countries, fast-paced technological progress, stratified and sometimes contradictory legal requirements, weak global institutions, and a rampant environmental crisis.  \n\nBusiness Ethics raises questions about a host of widely diverse issues: executive powers, corporate governance, covert monopolies, delocalized production and outsourced labor, unmet or distorted health standards, the commercial implications of genetic research, the patents and copyrights regime, the accountability of financial institutions, businesses\u2019 employment of political action committees to influence the outcome of legislation - along with the macro-themes of galloping technological development and the overall sustainability - ecological, economic, and social - of current production and consumption patterns.

    "info": "This course provides undergraduate students with the opportunity to undertake a research project in the context of their international education experience. Students opting for this course will be guided towards opportunities recommended by CAPA and determined by local resources and expertise. In most cases, CAPA will define potential projects generated by senior academic staff and faculty on site and suggest relevant sources: students will apply to do those projects. This would not preclude student proposals or projects suggested by home universities for individual or group study. Students will be introduced to core research concepts and will develop research skills through designing, executing, writing, and presenting their own research project within frameworks designed by CAPA.  The topics that students will explore will be consistent with their majors and their own individual interests but will exploit the overseas experience.\n\nA variety of research methods employed in geographical, historical, political, sociological, cultural studies, and digital humanities will be introduced that may be applied to multidisciplinary topics, including qualitative and quantitative methods, as well as mixed methods research as appropriate to students' research themes. In collaboration with their instructor, students will develop appropriate research methodologies that will engage with a range of local sources, as well as online resources. These will include archival documents such as official records, maps, and personal accounts as well as basic ethnographic techniques such as questionnaires, interviews, and oral histories. Students will also be introduced to contemporary social investigation and the use of artistic/fictional representations of place and environment, and the use of photographs and other multimedia sources as tools for analysis.\n",
