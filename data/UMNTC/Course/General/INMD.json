This course will offer students a hands-on opportunity to learn more about health policy and advocacy, and how the Minnesota Medical Association (MMA) functions as a unified voice of physicians for advancing the practice of medicine, the profession and patient health.\n\nThis course will provide medical students with experience in the following areas:\nPhysician involvement in health policy\nLegislative process \nState/regulatory policy development.\nRole of the courts and federal policy development\nGrassroots \n\nTo accomplish this goal, students will write and present a health policy issue brief to MMA staff, engage with policy makers and community stakeholders, write a letter to the editor, and at the end of the rotation, students will complete a reflection piece on what they have learned about the health policy process. (see below). \n\nJustification:\nHealth policy is a topic medical students are increasingly passionate about, but there is little opportunity in the 3rd and 4th year curriculum to gain exposure.  Exposure to the various components of health policy is needed in order to fully understand how health policy affects physicians and their patients.\n\n\n\n\n",
