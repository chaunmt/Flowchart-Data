This course will explore the New Testament from a different context, that of its first century birthplace. We will build students? understanding of the writings of the New Testament in the Roman Empire of the first century by gaining basic cultural knowledge of first century Greece, Rome, and Israel/Palestine and then reading the Gospels, the letters of Paul, and the Book of Revelation from the perspective of these intersecting worlds. The New Testament is grounded in this context, and deeper exploration of New Testament writings from a first-century perspective will help students enrich their understanding of modern references like the ones mentioned above.",

How beholden are the filmmakers to the interpretations of communities that view biblical texts as authoritative, and where are they free to depart from their sources? Is it possible to \"translate\" biblical narratives into film without losing something in the translation?",

At the same time, law is also the least understood part of Judaism and has often been the source of criticism and hatred. We shall therefore confront one of the most important parts of Jewish civilization and seek to understand it on its own terms. In demonstrating how law becomes a fundamental religious and ethical ideal, the course will focus on the biblical and Rabbinic periods but spans the entire history of Judaism. Consistent with the First Amendment, the approach taken is secular. There are no prerequisites: the course is open to all qualified students.The course begins with ideas of law in ancient Babylon and then studies the ongoing history of those ideas. The biblical idea that a covenant binds Israel to God, along with its implications for human worth - including the view of woman as person - will be examined. Comparative cultural issues include the reinterpretations of covenant within Christianity and Islam. The course investigates the rabbinic concept of oral law, the use of law to maintain the civil and religious stability of the Jewish people, and the kabbalistic transformation of law. The course concludes with contemporary Jewish thinkers who return to the Bible while seeking to establish a modern system of universal ethics.The premise of the course is the discipline of academic religious studies. The assumptions of the course are therefore academic and secular, as required by the First Amendment. All texts and all religious traditions will be examined analytically and critically. Students are expected to understand and master this approach, which includes questioning conventional cultural assumptions about the composition and authorship of the Bible. Willingness to ask such questions and openness to new ways of thinking are essential to success in the course.Old: Significance of religious law in Judaism. Babylonian background of biblical law. Biblical creation of the person as a legal category. Rabbinic transformations of biblical norms. Covenant in Christianity/Islam. Contemporary Jewish literature/philosophy.",

    "info": "Israel and Judah were not states of great importance in the ancient Near East.  Their population and territory were small, and they could not resist conquest by larger, more powerful states like Assyria and Rome.  Yet their ancient history matters greatly today, out of proportion to its insignificance during the periods in which it transpired.  The historical experiences of the people of Israel and Judah were accorded religious meaning and literary articulation in the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament), which became a foundational text for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.  Essential features of Western as well as Islamic civilization are predicated on some element of Israel\u2019s ancient past, as mediated through the Bible; therefore it behooves us to understand that past.  But the Bible is a religious work, not a transcript of events, and the history of ancient Israel is not derived merely from reading the biblical accounts of it.  Archaeological excavations have revealed the physical remains of the cultures of Israel and neighboring lands, as well as bringing to light inscriptions, documents, and literary works produced by those cultures.  These sources, which complement and sometimes contradict the accounts conveyed in the Bible, provide the basis for reconstructing a comprehensive history of ancient Israel.This course covers the history of Israel and Judah from the Late Bronze Age (c. 1550-1200 BCE), by the end of which Israel had emerged as a distinct ethnic entity, to the period of Roman rule (63 BCE-330 CE), which saw the final extinction of ancient Israel, represented by the kingdom of Judea, as a political entity.  Knowledge of this history is based on archaeological, epigraphic, and literary sources, including the Hebrew Bible.N.B.: Students should be aware that the study of history, like all the human and natural sciences, is predicated on inquiry, not a priori judgments.  Accordingly, the Bible is not privileged as an intrinsically true or authoritative record.  No text is presumed inerrant, and all sources are subject to scrutiny, in the context of scholarly discourse.  Biblical texts are treated just like all other texts, as the products of human beings embedded in a historical context, and as the subject of analysis and interpretation.  Persons of all faiths and of no faith are equally welcome to participate in such scholarly discourse.  However, students who feel that their own religious beliefs require an understanding of the Bible that is antithetical to the foregoing statements are cautioned that they may find themselves uncomfortable with this course.",

Along with discussing pertinent archaeological evidence, we will discuss Jewish literature and documentary material from this period, including, the sectarian documents of the Dead Sea Scrolls, the Book of Judith (a Jewish \"novel\"), the Books of Daniel and the Maccabees (all of which provide historical information about the Maccabean revolt and rise of the Hasmoneans), and the writings of Josephus (a Jewish writer who witnessed the Roman takeover of Palestine in the first century C.E.). This course will stay within the confines of the ancient evidence and not examine later interpretations when analyzing each historical period; it will begin with Ptolemaic control of the region and conclude with the Bar Kokhba revolt, its aftermath, and the resilience of Jewish populations in northern Palestine. Topics that will be examined in depth are messianism and apocalypticism, the Jerusalem Temple, Jewish ancestral traditions (which include \"biblical\" literature), and theoretical models used by scholars to analyze power relationships in antiquity.",

We will close by considering new challenges facing the church in an age of Enlightenment and Revolution. Though our geographic center of gravity will be in Europe, we will follow the expansion of Christianity into the Asian, African and American worlds and how developments here changed the nature of the church back in Europe. We will study religion as a phenomenon that affects human activity in a broad spectrum of area and activities.

People who hailed from North America, Europe, and Africa had divergent ideas about the divine and its presence on Earth, about life and life after death, about religious rituals and relations of authority.  Their struggles with one another were partly struggles over religiously inflected ways of being in the world.  The course explores how religion shaped people?s responses to European colonization, the growing slave-labor system, industrialization, immigration, and westward expansion.

We will address these issues and others as we explore the literature growing out of the Jewish immigrant experience in America, as well as the literature by Jewish writers more firmly, though still sometimes anxiously, rooted in American soil.In this course we will engage in a highly contextualized and historicized study of Jewish American literature from the 19th century to today.  We will discover in these texts how inherited Jewish culture and literary imaginings, developed over centuries of interaction between Jewish communities and the \u201coutside world,\u201d get reexamined, questioned, rejected, reimagined, reintegrated, and transformed within the crucible of American experience. The discussions that ensue will also provide a framework for engaging with the creative energies and cultural productivity of more recent immigrant communities in the United States and beyond. Immigration and the experience of immigrant communities continues to be at the forefront of American consciousness, as immigrants work to create new meanings and new narratives for their lives, and as those who immigrated before them provide contested meanings for the impact of immigration on their own narratives. This course, though grounded in Jewish narratives, will therefore provide students with an expanded vocabulary and perspective for engaging in this central and very current debate within the American experience.

    "info": "This course explores the multiple genealogical trajectories of Islamic thought in South Asia through the varied lens of its literary traditions. For centuries, literature has remained an important site for the expression of Islamic identity and its interaction with the larger history of the subcontinent. Muslim writers have traversed diverse domains of human experience through multiple genres: while poetry has been a widely celebrated genre for the expression of private love, drama has emerged as a crucial site for public politics and activism. In this course, students will read texts that have circulated across South Asia and interpret them in relation to enduring questions about power, justice, identity, community and love (both human and divine) in Islam. Reading a wide array of works from diverse temporal and spatial locations, this course examines how the aesthetic and discursive world of South Asia provides a terrain on which the Islamic \"socius\" of the region has come to define itself in a unique manner. In addition, we also investigate how these literary cultures-at different historical junctures-articulated a secular ethos to define Hindu-Muslim relations in the subcontinent. We further discuss questions of genres-epic, romance, drama, novel and lyric-as a way of thinking about the circulation of literary forms across languages, cultures and national spaces in the past and the present.

It aims to first develop an understanding of the mystical perspectives within Islam that have influenced most of the world\u2019s Muslim population, and then to understand how that tradition has changed under the conditions of modernity. Throughout Islamic history, Sufis (Islamic mystics) developed fascinating philosophical theories and beautiful literature, attempting to answer questions about the meaning of life and the nature of reality. We will read Islamic mystical texts that explore everything from hidden meanings of the Qur\u2019an, to dreams and supernatural powers, to sex, love, and spiritual connection with God, written by mystics from Africa to the Middle East to China and beyond. We will also examine what happens to Sufism in the modern period, given challenges from colonialism as well as alternate schools of thought within Islam, and consider the writings of the Sufis\u2019 opponents: Salafis, socialists, secularists, and other modernizers.\n\nAll readings will be in English translation and no prior knowledge of Islam or foreign languages is required for this class.",

We will study how South Asia's diverse ethnic and religious communities interacted, observing how visual and material cultures reflect differences, adaptations, and shared aesthetic practices within this diversity of traditions. Students in this class will have mastered a body of knowledge about Indian art and probed multiple modes of inquiry. We will explore how Muslim rulers brought new traditions yet maintained many older ones making, for example, the first mosque in India that combines Muslim and Indic visual idioms. We will study the developments leading to magnificent structures, such as the Taj Mahal, asking why such a structure could be built when Islam discourages monumental mausolea.  In what ways the schools of painting that are the products of both Muslim and Hindu rulers different and similar? The course will also consider artistic production in the important Hindu kingdoms that ruled India concurrently with the great Muslim powers. In the 18th century, colonialist forces enter the subcontinent, resulting in significant innovative artistic trends. Among questions we will ask is how did these kingdoms influence one another? Throughout we will probe which forms and ideas seem to be inherently Indian, asking which ones transcend dynastic, geographic and religious differences and which forms and ideas are consistent throughout these periods of political and ideological change.  To do all this we must constantly consider how South Asia's diverse ethnic and religious communities interact.There are no prerequisites for this course.",

In classroom discussions, we will work together to create an interpretive model that is synthetic, critical, and appreciative of the enormously diverse field that is South Asian Art. Lectures will move from explanatory descriptions of objects and histories that are covered in the textbook to critical interpretations of the historiographies that shape their contemporary reception. Class discussions and assignments are intended to encourage students to bring their own ways of looking at this art, to read critically in light of what they see, and to consider new approaches to the material.

    "info": "Our subtitle is \u201csacredness.\u201d The operational presupposition of the class is that sacredness is more than a mental phenomenon: it involves objects and bodies. Modern perspectives on religion have long downplayed this \u201cmaterial\u201d aspect as they privileged iconoclastic spirituality. The anthropology of religion aims to go beyond the material/spiritual opposition and asks how rituals employ objects and bodies in order to capture the effect we might call spiritual or mystical. Intellectually, this is an extremely difficult wisdom for the moderns to grasp because the binary oppositions between the spiritual and the material, between mind and the body, subtend modern society\u2019s very sense of order and rationality. This class is successful if we can have even a glimpse of how much difficulty we moderns have in seeing beyond these binaries. \nTake, for example, sacrifice. It is almost intuitive that the human condition abides in the requisition of sacrifice: redemption is found by suffering, abundance secured by loss, and the gift of life enabled by death. Such an intuition is as universal as its practiced intent is ambiguous to us. Ambiguous because the following questions immediately rise: For whom or in whose \"eyes\" is a gesture of sacrificial offering supposed to be accounted for? If one facilitates one\u2019s own death in the hands of one\u2019s enemy in a redemptive gesture\u2014which is, arguably, the case of Jesus Christ\u2014would the enemy part of the redeemed? We will raise the most impenetrable of such questions through compelling examples in contemporary politics, such as the post-9/11 category of so-called religiously-motivated protest suicide. As Talal Asad argues, one of the reasons the \"suicide bombing\" is so disconcerting to us is not because of the extent of its violence\u2014which is not remarkable compared to technology-driven terror tactics\u2014but because the act violates our dearest binaries: victim/victimizer, dying/killing, means/ends, and crime/punishment. At the bottom of these binaries, as we will see in this class, is the binary opposition between materiality and spirituality. This issue will be expanded into modern society in the latter part of the class. \n\nThere are no prerequisites for this class. ",

At the same time, law is also the least understood part of Judaism and has often been the source of criticism and hatred. We shall therefore confront one of the most important parts of Jewish civilization and seek to understand it on its own terms. In demonstrating how law becomes a fundamental religious and ethical ideal, the course will focus on the biblical and Rabbinic periods but spans the entire history of Judaism. Consistent with the First Amendment, the approach taken is secular. There are no prerequisites: the course is open to all qualified students.The course begins with ideas of law in ancient Babylon and then studies the ongoing history of those ideas. The biblical idea that a covenant binds Israel to God, along with its implications for human worth - including the view of woman as person - will be examined. Comparative cultural issues include the reinterpretations of covenant within Christianity and Islam. The course investigates the rabbinic concept of oral law, the use of law to maintain the civil and religious stability of the Jewish people, and the kabbalistic transformation of law. The course concludes with contemporary Jewish thinkers who return to the Bible while seeking to establish a modern system of universal ethics.The premise of the course is the discipline of academic religious studies. The assumptions of the course are therefore academic and secular, as required by the First Amendment. All texts and all religious traditions will be examined analytically and critically. Students are expected to understand and master this approach, which includes questioning conventional cultural assumptions about the composition and authorship of the Bible. Willingness to ask such questions and openness to new ways of thinking are essential to success in the course.",

We will study how South Asia\u2019s diverse ethnic and religious communities interacted, observing how visual and material cultures reflect differences, adaptations, and shared aesthetic practices within this diversity of traditions. Students in this class will have mastered a body of knowledge about Indian art and probed multiple modes of inquiry. We will explore how Muslim rulers brought new traditions yet maintained many older ones making, for example, the first mosque in India that combines Muslim and Indic visual idioms. We will study the developments leading to magnificent structures, such as the Taj Mahal, asking why such a structure could be built when Islam discourages monumental mausolea.  In what ways the schools of painting that are the products of both Muslim and Hindu rulers different and similar? The course will also consider artistic production in the important Hindu kingdoms that ruled India concurrently with the great Muslim powers. In the 18th century, colonialist forces enter the subcontinent, resulting in significant innovative artistic trends. Among questions we will ask is how did these kingdoms influence one another? Throughout we will probe which forms and ideas seem to be inherently Indian, asking which ones transcend dynastic, geographic and religious differences and which forms and ideas are consistent throughout these periods of political and ideological change.  To do all this we must constantly consider how South Asia's diverse ethnic and religious communities interact.",
