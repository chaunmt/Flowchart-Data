Students will engage in inquiry, planning, classroom teaching and reflection as they participate on a team developing curriculum in a partial day English immersion classroom. Through readings, videos, a homestay experience, small group projects, classroom observations, and participation as part of a team of English teachers in Brazil, students will gain an introduction to Brazilian culture, learn the basics of the local education system, and experience firsthand what it is like to learn a new language. Students will next be exposed to some of the basic elements of early childhood second language teaching, will help to plan and co-deliver relevant and appropriate curriculum, write lesson plans and engage in reflective practice with their teaching team. Finally, because of the cultural immersion element of the class, students will be supported to 1) reflect on their personal cultural adjustment process, 2) develop an effective working relationship with their co-teachers, and 3) consider the ethical dilemma present in the provision of educational opportunity to Brazil\u0092s marginalized communities.

Although students who complete this course become familiar with major theoretical and applied approaches to clinical interventions and psychotherapy practice, the focus is not on gaining mastery in any particular psychotherapy approach. Instead, this course focuses on developing an understanding of fundamental principles of clinical interventions, therapeutic techniques, and psychotherapy practice, including the nature and underlying mechanisms of therapeutic change, research methods for evaluating the efficacy and effectiveness of clinical interventions and psychotherapy at the group and individual levels, a critical evaluation of contemporary psychotherapy approaches, and limitations in the current evidence base. In addition to readings and in-class discussions, students participate in in-person, group applications of basic clinical skills, including activities to help prepare them for beginning psychotherapy practice. This course thus provides a framework for understanding and applying the theories, principles, and methods of effective clinical interventions for students who will subsequently train in intervention-focused, in-person psychotherapy practica.
