The second part of the course covers firms with differentiated products and market power with particular focus on pricing models such as segmentation, bundling, and two part tariffs. Pricing models involve profit maximization and associated conceptual tools. The course touches on game theory and strategic interaction among small numbers of firms and ends with a discussion of market failure and the business opportunities that they sometimes create. The course also emphasizes links to other parts of the core business curriculum. The course makes extensive reference to statistical empirical examples.",

Managerial decisions can be broken down into two main categories: how to raise capital and how to employ capital. The decisions managers make in this context can add or destroy value. With this context in mind, the course provides students with an understanding of financial markets and the main types of securities that are issued by corporations. The course will leverage basic statistics in understanding of risk of a security as a stand-alone investment and as part of a well-diversified portfolio to provide an understanding of how risk affects required returns of investors. The course emphasizes the concept of time value of money as a basis for decision making. Managers make decisions that affect the cash flows of the firm; the course provides students with a context for thinking about forecasting cash flows, discounting cash flows, and assessing whether the decisions they are considering are value-added for the firm.",

We then analyze how firms innovate and adapt their capabilities over time, especially in the digital age. We extend our analysis to the scope choices of the firm and discuss how firms can successfully compete across multiple countries and businesses. Throughout the course, case discussions examine and simulate the process through which strategic decisions are made and carried out. Students are placed in the role of decision-makers and frequently asked to analyze the key choices they must make to define, reinforce, and successfully implement the firm's strategy.",
