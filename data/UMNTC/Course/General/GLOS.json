Is it possible to reduce - or to bring an end - to these gross violations of human rights? The course seeks to imagine new strategies to address current-day human rights challenges. In the process of conceptualizing unique strategies, students examine the complex social forces that impede human rights. Students will write a strategy paper on a contemporary human rights challenge, develop a unique non-governmental organization (NGO), and participate in a simulation of the United Nations Security Council.",

To begin with, its practitioners adhere to the principle of respecting the humanity and equality of those whom they fight against. Moreover, as Gandhi notes, it is democratic in the sense that while it requires immense self- discipline, it is nevertheless a universally available weapon. This course provides a historical exploration of some of the concepts and practices of non-violence.  The questions we shall be exploring are: Why is it only in the twentieth century that non-violence as a political ideology can be articulated?  What is the violence that non-violence eschews?  Why is the language of self-transformation and self-sacrifice so important to non-violent movements?  What specific practices of non-violence does non-violence involve?  Why do some of the most powerful practitioners of non-violence, such as Gandhi or MLK, describe their practices in religious terms?  When can non-violent politics reinforce existing injustices, or unwittingly collude in more subtle forms of violence?  When do non-violent movements succeed, and what would count as \u201csuccess\u201d for non-violent politics?   What role can and does it play in the contemporary world, which has been transformed by social media, deeper state penetration, and more intense social divisions, and where mobilizations such as BLM, the Arab Spring, or the Umbrella movement still draw on the concepts and practices of non-violence? We shall be reading both some of the most famous practitioners and thinkers of non-violence, and some of their trenchant critics\u2014Thoreau, Gandhi, MLK, Arendt, Fanon, Thurman, Mandela, amongst others.

How might we think of ignorance, too, as something constructed?  We then turn from theory to practice, and to the question, how can we frame our questions, and enact our research in humble and ethically principled ways?  Students will respond to this task by designing collaborative research projects.  They will first identify and define a real world issue; they will review different disciplines' methods for defining and approaching the issue, and then they will jointly create a collaborative research design.

Americans gave away $450 billion in 2019, or a little over 2 percent of our country's GDP (Giving USA 2020). A few mega-philanthropists, such as Bill Gates, Warren Buffett, Michael Bloomberg and others donated mind-boggling sums of money. These individuals and their foundations are having a significant impact around the world, changing the way public education is carried out in many countries, how global health priorities are defined, how public policies are made, and how African agricultural systems are organized. \n\nForbes magazine reports that there are 1,645 billionaires in the world today, 80% more than a decade ago. While some observers look positively on this philanthropic outpouring, others suggest it may be eroding democracy. In this course, we study philanthropy from a variety of perspectives, exploring who gives away money and why, how this \"gift\" impacts givers, receivers, and taxpayers, and what the relationship is between global philanthropy and power.  Specific topics include the history of foundations; religion and charity; philanthropy and politics; consumption-based giving (or \"brand aid\"), and philanthropy and social policy. We'll examine case studies such as the Gates Foundation's role in African agriculture. Students will do \"participant observation\" in a local charity, and a research project on the philanthropic foundation or giving practice of their choice.",

The course explores the conceptual underpinnings of human rights such as who is eligible to have rights, where those rights come from and who is responsible for guaranteeing them.  Students will learn about how international laws are made and interpreted, and will consider the geo-political context which shapes human rights laws and procedures. Because of the evolving nature of the laws and issues in this field, students are encouraged to think analytically and ethically about how to address the many human rights challenges in the world today.  The course will cover current human rights issues, including the right to health care, housing and other economic and social rights; and the right to life, freedom from torture and other civil and political rights. The course is writing intensive. The required paper for the class is a model complaint to the United Nations about a country and issue of the student's choosing.

The course examines the cultural, political, and historical origins of Islamophobic discourses that cast Muslims as \"violent,\" \"hateful,\" and \"uncivilized.\" Class sessions will include some lecture but will be largely discussion based.

    "info": "'Globalization' and 'Culture' are both terms that have been defined and understood in a variety of ways and the significance of which continues to be debated to the present, both inside and outside the academy.  Globalization has been talked about both as an irresistible historical force, tending toward the creation of an increasingly interconnected, or, as is sometimes claimed, an increasingly homogeneous world, and as a set of processes, the outcome of which remains open-ended and uncertain, as likely to produce new kinds of differences as universal sameness.  Culture meanwhile has been variously defined as that which distinguishes humans from other species (and which all humans therefore share) and as that which divides communities of humans from one another on the basis of different beliefs, customs, values etc. This course reflects on some of the possible meanings of both \"Globalization\" and \"Culture\" and asks what we can learn by considering them in relation to one another.  How do the phenomena associated with globalization, such as increasing flows of people, capital, goods and information across increasing distances challenge our understandings of culture, including the idea that the world is composed of so many discrete and bounded \"cultures\"? At the same time, does culture and its associated expressive forms, including narrative fiction, poetry and film, furnish us with new possibilities for thinking about globalization?  Does global interconnection produce a single, unified world, or multiple worlds?  Are the movements of people, goods, ideas and information across distances associated with new developments caused by contemporary globalization, or have they been going on for centuries or even millennia? Might contemporary debates about climate change and environmental crisis compel us to consider these phenomena in new ways?  The course addresses these questions as they have been discussed by scholars from a variety of disciplines and as they have been imagined by artists, poets, novelists and filmmakers. In doing so, it considers whether the distinctiveness of present day globalization is to be sought in part in the new forms of imagining and creative expression to which it has given rise.\n",

In GLOS 3606, Art and Incarceration: Prison Voices and Visions, we will read, view, and listen to creative work by incarcerated artists from around the world, and we will consider: \n\n(1) what these artists have to say about the(ir) world(s), \n\n(2) how art provides a space for resistance and survival within the walls of the prison, and (3) how the conditions of incarceration impact the creative process and affect our access to this important body of work.\n\nBecause the purpose of this course is to amplify and analyze the voices and visions of incarcerated artists, this course requires substantial reading, viewing, and listening.

    "info": "For most of us, stories seem to simply 'happen.' We listen to stories, we tell stories, we are moved by stories, and we retell stories. However, every act of telling stories involves making decisions or moves, and each re-telling of a familiar story may either give birth to new meanings, nuances, and affects, or, it may erase their possibility. Thus, each storyteller can be seen as a translator of stories with a responsibility to retell stories ethically. It is precisely through these translational acts that all politics become politics of storytelling. In this course, we will consider the ways in which the politics of the global and the intimate derive their meanings, effects, and affects from the circulation, transaction, and re-tellings of stories within and across borders.  We will ask how a praxis of ethical engagement with politics can be imagined as a praxis of receiving and retelling stories. By immersing ourselves in the process of remembering, telling, listening, trimming, interweaving, distilling, and performing stories, we will consider how ethical receiving and retelling of stories involves continuous revising, repositioning, and re-theorizing of such vexed and entangled terrains and terminologies as identity, community, rights, and justice, as well as the contingent meanings of knowledge, truth, and ethics.\n\nThis course engages this terrain through a mode of active learning in which all the participants will read and reflect, listen and discuss, tell and retell, watch and play, move and perform collectively. By becoming aware of the ways in which our minds-bodies-souls are inserted in the receiving and translation of stories, we will grapple together with the ways in which our bodies--as our embodiments--help to relationally shape not only our own performances but also our responses to the performances of other living and moving bodies around us. \n\nWe will learn from writings, film, songs, and plays by writers, artists, activists, and thinkers from a range of historical and contemporary locations and struggles. These include: Marie Lily Cerat, W. E. B. Du Bois, Suheir Hammad, Sterlin Harjo, Naeem Inayatullah, June Jordan, AnaLouise Keating, Kauanui, J.

    "info": "Somali British poet Warsan Shire\u2019s 2009 poem \u201cHome\u201d beseeches readers to \u201cunderstand/ that no one puts their children in a boat/ unless the water is safer than the land.\u201d  The poem went viral in 2015, shared widely by those attempting to counter the virulent anti-migrant rhetoric animating political discourse and elections in the US and around the world.  The rise in authoritarianism and racist nationalisms, especially in Europe and in settler states, is evident in policies such as the US \u201cRemain in Mexico\u201d policy, the EU\u2019s increased externalization of immigration enforcement and policies of deterrence, and Australia\u2019s mandatory offshore detention. But this anti-migrant turn is not new, and this course argues that the criminalization of migration and migrants (and of the mobility of indigenous people across state borders - even when those borders divide their nations) has a long history that is deeply ingrained in our most fundamental understandings of the state, borders, and belonging. In this interdisciplinary course, students will both unpack that history and engage - through literature and film - migrant voices that contest the dehumanization and criminalization of their lives and communities, speaking back not only to the most aggressive forms of xenophobia, but to the more widely held opinion that there are \u201cgood immigrants\u201d and \u201cbad immigrants.\u201d We will approach these topics through three key concepts: borders, crossings, and detention.

    "info": "The world today confronts a volatile scenario shaped by three intertwined political-economic processes: First, growth in surplus value or corporate profits fueled by monopoly capitalism, wage stagnation, and automation-driven improvements in productivity; second, growth in surplus or discarded matter fueled by rising consumerism and planned obsolescence in products and services; and finally, growth in surplus humanity or under-employed, unwanted populations fueled by structural transformations in the world economy with declining opportunities for good quality jobs. The combined result manifests as widening economic inequality between the 'haves' and 'have nots'; a politically volatile situation of racialized polarization in which huge numbers of people in entire regions, countries, or sectors of the globe, have little, declining, or no access to secure waged work; and an ecological crisis where the planet finds itself ill equipped to handle growing quantities of waste matter, including greenhouse gases. Our primary focus in the course will be to understand populations that are \"cast out\" of society, the forces that produce this condition, the mechanisms of rule by which surplus populations are managed, and the way people live and cope with their superfluity.\n\nClass sessions are a combination of lectures, debates, student-led discussions, and audio-visual materials. 60-70 pages of weekly reading, bi-weekly commentaries, take-home midterms, short presentation, and final paper.",

Other research and data agencies credit contemporary African societies with among the fastest rates of urban expansion in the world. Such stupendous demographic surge and breakneck acceleration of urban growth have engendered intense dislocation and cultural upheaval in populations caught between two competing narratives of social change: one of celebration; the other of crisis. This course explores contemporary sub-Saharan African popular cinema, popular music, TV/radio series, bus slogans, community theatre, graphic narratives, fashion, sports, and other forms of popular communication as signifiers of larger social, political, and economic processes. It examines popular cultural forms as constantly evolving expressions of social, political, and personal identities in an ever globalized and interconnected world. As sites where the tensions, frictions, collisions and notably, the productive creativities of the local and the global are circulated, negotiated and contested African popular cultures provide insights into a unique and increasingly crucial facet of contemporary African artistic practice as critical intervention. Through our discussion of art and gender, we will examine the gendering of specific popular forms, their role in hegemonic formations, as well as their subversion in resistant practices and discourses.",

In postcolonial Africa and Asia, where arts were linked to national modernization projects, artists have played a key role in shaping citizens' identity, alongside schools and universities. While participating in modernizing projects, avant-garde artists maintained independence from state institutions and voiced criticism of dictators. This course examines avant-garde performance in several locations of the Global South, analyzing dramas of national history, modernist music, activist theater, cosmopolitan dance, transnational cultural circuits, and politically radical performances. \n\nReading historical, social, and performance studies, we will develop methods for analyzing performances that aim to make transformative social interventions. These include textual analysis, ethnography, performance analysis, and tracking transnational cultural exchange. You will apply select methods in your final research paper, which centers on an avant gardist cultural phenomenon in the contemporary Global South.",

To examine these questions, we will use case studies across various industries that focus on issues including supply chains and labor conditions, environmental practices, and violations by security forces employed by multinational corporations; 3) The readings and seminars will encourage students to explore the debates about the most effective ways for businesses to protect and advance respect for human rights, prevent violations, and provide redress to victims of violations that occur as a result of their actions/inaction and defend themselves when they are falsely accused; 4) A research paper due at the end of the semester will encourage students to integrate different arguments and course materials, conduct related independent research and develop their own arguments. We will use a combination of discussions, collaborative exercises, and conversations with guest speakers working in different aspects of business and human rights work.",

    "info": "For most of us, stories seem to simply 'happen.' We listen to stories, we tell stories, we are moved by stories, and we retell stories. However, every act of telling stories involves making decisions or moves, and each re-telling of a familiar story may either give birth to new meanings, nuances, and affects, or, it may erase their possibility. Thus, each storyteller can be seen as a translator of stories with a responsibility to retell stories ethically. It is precisely through these translational acts that all politics become politics of storytelling. In this course, we will consider the ways in which the politics of the global and the intimate derive their meanings, effects, and affects from the circulation, transaction, and re-tellings of stories within and across borders.  We will ask how a praxis of ethical engagement with politics can be imagined as a praxis of receiving and retelling stories. By immersing ourselves in the process of remembering, telling, listening, trimming, interweaving, distilling, and performing stories, we will consider how ethical receiving and retelling of stories involves continuous revising, repositioning, and re-theorizing of such vexed and entangled terrains and terminologies as identity, community, rights, and justice, as well as the contingent meanings of knowledge, truth, and ethics.\n\nThis course engages this terrain through a mode of active learning in which all the participants will read and reflect, listen and discuss, tell and retell, watch and play, move and perform collectively. By becoming aware of the ways in which our minds-bodies-souls are inserted in the receiving and translation of stories, we will grapple together with the ways in which our bodies--as our embodiments--help to relationally shape not only our own performances but also our responses to the performances of other living and moving bodies around us. \n\nWe will learn from writings, film, songs, and plays by writers, artists, activists, and thinkers from a range of historical and contemporary locations and struggles. These include: Marie Lily Cerat, W. E. B. Du Bois, Suheir Hammad, Sterlin Harjo, Naeem Inayatullah, June Jordan, AnaLouise Keating, Kauanui, J. Kehaulani, Audre Lorde, Viet Thanh Nguyen, Middle East Research and Information Project, Munshi Premchand, Alok Rai, Nina Simone, Leanne Betasamosake Simpson, Sangtin Writers, Standing Rock Collective, Eve Tuck, Patrick Wolfe, and K. Wayne Yang. Many of the 'Acts' in this course will be co-facilitated with local or international artists and writers.\n\nGrading Basis: A/F. The course requires all the participants to do sustained work and deep reflections, enjoy the process of imagining and creating with peers in a non-competitive environment.\n\nPrereq:  For graduate students only, or with instructor consent.  People from all kinds of locations and journeys are invited to join us in this collective exploration. For further information, email: nagar@umn.edu.",
