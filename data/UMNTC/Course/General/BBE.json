In this course, students explore our wide range of traditional and renewable energy sources and how these options impact our environment and society. Students are also exposed to the complex and compelling ethical issues raised by global, national, and local changes in how we produce and use energy. This course informs and engages students to be thoughtful, rather than passive consumers of energy. Students gain the knowledge necessary to be articulate in career, community, and personal arenas regarding renewable energy resources. In addition, students develop the ability to evaluate and respond to present and future technological changes that impact their energy use in the workplace, at home, and in the community. This course was designed and offered as an online course since 2011. ",

Microbiology is the discipline that studies the basic biology and fundamental processes of microbes with the aim of answering and solving the relevant environmental and industrial questions. Microbiology remains a frontier but has developed significantly in recent years. Growth in this research area is largely due to vast improvements in molecular tools (for example: genome sequencing and editing, microscopes, data analysis) and other biochemical techniques, often driven by interest in emergent applications for these unique organisms. These applications include those related to protecting environmental quality as well as those related to making novel products, including materials, fuels, and chemicals. These also include understanding the roles of microbes in the natural nutrient cycles and other key natural processes. This course is therefore designed to introduce students to the taxonomy, biology, and ecology of microbes and to focus on key applications for which these microbes can be applied.\n\nprereq:  BIOL 1001 or BIOL 1009 or BIOL 2003 and CHEM 1015 or CHEM 1061 or CHEM 1081.",

Microbiology is the discipline that studies the basic biology and fundamental processes of microbes, with the aim of answering and solving the relevant environmental and industrial questions. Microbiology remains a frontier but has developed significantly in recent years. Growth in this research area is largely due to vast improvements in molecular tools (for example, genome sequencing and editing, microscopes, data analysis) and other biochemical techniques, often driven by interest in emergent applications for these unique organisms. These applications include those related to protecting environmental quality as well as those related to making novel products, including materials, fuels, and chemicals. These also include understanding the roles of microbes in the natural nutrient cycles and other key natural processes. This course is therefore designed to introduce students to the taxonomy, biology, and ecology of microbes, and to focus on key applications for which these microbes can be applied.\n\nprereq: Graduate student",
