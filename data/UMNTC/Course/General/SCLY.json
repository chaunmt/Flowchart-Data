While Italy is among the EU Member States that received the highest number of sea arrivals, within Italy Sicily was the major disembarkation location, accounting for 68% of the total number of sea arrivals in the country between 2014 and 2018. By receiving a large flow of people on the move, Sicily stands out as a crucial venue where to interact and engage with contemporary migration challenges and narratives. It offers the opportunity to study the many aspects of migration in Europe and in the Mediterranean in terms of politics, policies, and polity and in terms of the convoluted interaction among different narratives, discourses and actors (migrants and civil society\u2019s voices, politicians, border guards, sea rescuers, human smugglers, media, etc.). Moreover, it allows comparative reflections with other critical southern borders.\n",

    "info": "Building a new business is a difficult endeavor anywhere in the world; tenacity, creativity, and endless intrinsic motivation are needed to drive the entrepreneurial spirit. Successful entrepreneurship also requires government and institutional support, infrastructure, and investment. This is clear in the development of \u201chubs\u201d \u2014tech, finance, AI, etc.\u2014in urban centers around the globe. Such factors create business ecosystems where new entrants to a specific field can thrive. This is also true in Italy.\n\nAs one of the world\u2019s most industrialized economies, Italy has important manufacturing, finance, and agricultural hubs that foster entrepreneurial growth. However, in Southern Italy, the obstacles to entrepreneurship are outsized in comparison to Northern Italy. Poor infrastructure, low cooperation, and a lack of entrepreneurial education have helped to perpetuate the slow development of the South. Young people often move north or abroad to study and work. This phenomenon, oftentimes dubbed the \u201cbrain drain,\u201d can also be seen replicated in other highly industrialized countries, where capital, knowledge, and labor end up concentrating in specific geographical areas creating social divides. Nonetheless, entrepreneurship in Southern Italy is growing. In recent years, over 50% of new small businesses registered in Italy were concentrated in the South and Island regions of the country. Thanks to focused national and regional funding initiatives and collective advocacy movements for business development in Southern Italy, new companies have been able to take root. \n",

Sicily can be viewed as a microcosm of global supply chain challenges and as a laboratory for ethical business practices. From international labor market competition and inequality to the logistics of operating from an island and the implications of corruption and organized crime, businesses of all scales find themselves benefitting from the island\u2019s geopolitical integration in the European Union but also struggling with poor infrastructure, transnational competition, complex transportation logistics, and shifting cultural beliefs. \n\nThis course focuses on the language and tools of sustainability and responsibility as new standard currencies in business and challenges students to consider complex issues of ethics and integrity within real-world business cases in the Sicilian economic and socio-cultural context. As a result of this analysis, students will better understand the realities of applying ethical frameworks to complex, global business environments, and also recognize the medium- and long-term impacts of corporate decisions that can lead to not only thriving businesses ready to adapt to the demands of new and evolving markets, but also to sustain local communities and address complex economic and social challenges through innovation.\n",

They will help divide the work into manageable parts and smaller working groups, and you will collaboratively determine ambitious, yet achievable goals given the meeting schedule for the summer practicum.\n\nYou will be working alongside other design students (apparel design, architecture, graphic design, interior design, product design, and retail merchandising) to realize at least some aspects of the design proposal at full scale\u2014as prototypes, partial models, or bespoke objects or events. In previous terms, for example, community projects included: designing and building a gateway structure at the edge of the sea, implementing way finding strategies, and screen printing apparel and accessories\u2014all as part of neighborhood revitalization; and generating adaptive reuse strategies for an historic structure in the center of Ortigia, which included graphic identity and branding, prototyping furniture and build-outs, and hosting a communal event to share ideas.\n\nImportantly, your time commitment for this course is determined as a work schedule might be in a firm. You are expected to attend and work/learn at the scheduled meeting times; there is no expectation for practicum work outside of your scheduled hours. (The work/learn meeting schedule will, in total, meet workload expectations for a 3-credit course.)",

However, unsustainable practices threaten the balance of marine ecosystems. Climate change, pollution, and other human-induced, anthropogenic pressures lead to ongoing global change in marine environments, including water acidification, sea surface warming, sea water level rising, deoxygenation, and changes in nutrient and light regimes. These changes alter multiple chemical and physical seawater properties, propagating to diverse marine microorganisms, through the entire food chain, up to the top predators, including humans.\nMarine biodiversity is essential for balanced food webs, which in turn enable ecosystems to be more adaptable to key challenges such as climate change, habitat degradation, and other major ecological disruptions. Within this framework, mitigation actions, management plans, and the establishment of protected areas, along with responsible and sustainable management of marine resources can be strategic for the restoration of damaged species communities and habitats.\nField trips in the coastal areas of Eastern Sicily allow students to observe the presence of marine vulnerable species and their coexistence with anthropogenic activities.
