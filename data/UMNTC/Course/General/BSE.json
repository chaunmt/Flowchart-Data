    "info": "The BSE major is built on the idea that problems of biology, health, and the environment emerge at the intersection of natural and human systems. Understanding these problems and their solutions, and building skill sets to address them, requires experience in the biological and natural sciences as well as in the social sciences and humanities. In this introduction to the BSE major, you\u2019ll explore the interconnectedness of biology, society, and environment through a series of \u201ccase study\u201d modules that include lectures, videos, readings, and discussions. You\u2019ll also complete some very practical exercises to help you consider how you might develop your own unique path through the BSE major, in ways that are relevant to your personal and/or professional interests and goals.\n\nMust be completed prior to senior year.",
