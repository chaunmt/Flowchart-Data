Viewpoints surrounding each topic will be scrutinized through the lens of current brain and behavioral research. Students will gain a deeper ability to think critically and scientifically about popular beliefs regarding substance use. For instance, despite decades of study, existing research does not make clear whether brain deficits in human substance users are caused by misuse of substances, or caused by pre-existing factors (e.g., genetics, home environment) that predate substance use and predispose individuals to misuse in the first place. The course will draw from interesting new research conducted by faculty at the University of Minnesota and elsewhere to gain insight into this uncertainty.

Given this state of affairs, numerous policies and initiatives have emerged, designed to shape our behavior -- to help us eat better, be more active, drink responsibly, refrain from smoking, use fewer resources, recycle more, to name but a few.  And even a cursory review of these efforts reveals they can take many forms including the provision of incentives; the implementation of bans or mandates; supports for self-monitoring; the restructuring of behaviors to make them more accessible; the use of warning labels; or the dissemination of messages to heighten awareness, model behavior, or shape beliefs.  What determines which strategies are used for which problems?  Are these strategies effective?  If so, why?  If not, why not?  We will spend the semester grappling with challenge of trying to shape human behavior.  Together, we will examine policies and initiatives that are currently in place, think through how they are supposed to work, and try to determine whether (or when) they are effective.  Together we will form recommendations regarding best practices; recognizing where current efforts are succeeding and offer advice for where we can do better. ",

In this practicum, students gain substantial experience working with children in off-campus settings under the supervision of Board Certified Behavior Analysts who are engaged in the direct application of ABA and behavior therapy. This field experience involves a minimum of 7 hours per week for 12 weeks. Each week, the students participate in two 3-hour, one-on-one therapy sessions at either a home-based or center-based ABA program site, plus one 1-hour clinical review meeting at that site. Students also attend one 1.5-hour lecture/discussion session and complete weekly reading assignments. Students are introduced to the principles and methods currently employed to help young children with autism acquire functional language and appropriate social behavior, and control autistic behavior. Issues of professional ethics, social responsibility, and scientific and moral philosophy pertaining to the treatment of children with autism are also addressed. Grading is based on appropriate participation in the service-learning activities, competency evaluations at the service-learning site, and performance on a final exam.

In this practicum, students gain substantial experience working with children in off-campus settings under the supervision of Board Certified Behavior Analysts who are engaged in the direct application of ABA and behavior therapy. This field experience involves a minimum of 7 hours per week for 12 weeks. Each week, the students participate in two 3-hour, one-on-one therapy sessions at either a home-based or center-based ABA program site, plus one 1-hour clinical review meeting at that site. Students also attend one 1.5-hour lecture/discussion session and complete weekly reading assignments. Students are introduced to the principles and methods currently employed to help young children with autism acquire functional language and appropriate social behavior, and control autistic behavior. Issues of professional ethics, social responsibility, and scientific and moral philosophy pertaining to the treatment of children with autism are also addressed. Grading is based on appropriate participation in the service-learning activities, competency evaluations at the service-learning site, and performance on a final exam. The prerequisite for the course is either Psy 4011/5011: Applied Behavior Analysis, or a comparable course or experience. Students who have prior mastery of the technical vocabulary of ABA are given preference.\n\nprereq: Individual auto transportation, instr consent",

Is the neural view of decision making as a logical consequence of brain states incompatible with free-will? Can all of conscious experience (qualia) be reduced to neurobiology?

Consequently, they are measured by observing manifestations of them that are assumed to adequately reflect the underlying latent variables.  These observables are typically test questions that have predetermined correct and incorrect options for ability, achievement, and other cognitive variables. For personality, attitudes, and other variables the test questions are based on self report. Two general types of theories are in use for measuring both types of these variables\u2014classical test theory (CTT) and item response theory (IRT).  Both theories address measurement issues for both types of variables differently. Taking a practical approach, this course compares both theories in terms of the methods for constructing, refining, scoring, interpretation, applications, and criteria for evaluating the adequacy of measuring instruments developed by both CTT and IRT. Topics include methods of item analysis, special problems of the two types of methods that are unique to the two general types of variables, and special topics including equating, differential item functioning, and multidimensionality. Advantages and limitations of both CTT and IRT will also be discussed.\t",

Unlike most traditional history of psychology courses, we will focus less on the emergence and differentiation of various schools of psychological thought, and more about the emergence and differentiation of various methods of empirical and theoretical inquiry. Unlike traditional methods courses, we will focus less on specific research designs and analytic techniques, and more on broader issues of inference that permeate all psychological research (i.e., meta-psychology). Unlike both traditional history and methodological courses, we will integrate a focus on the racial and socio-structural aspects of both history and methods. \n\nImportantly, the historical focus of the course will be grounded in contemporary methodological issues in the context of the open science movement, both to illustrate how many of the current issues in the field have persisted for decades, but also to highlight the tremendous advances in potential solutions we have seen in recent years. Through this course, students will develop a basic familiarity with a core set of issues in the history of psychology and will be competent in rudimentary open science and meta-psychology. These skills are intended to greatly enhance the research acumen of the students, both as rigorous producers of new research and informed consumers of existing work.  ",

Intended for those with some training in statistics but little or none in practical programming, this course provides psychology students with a range of specific skills related to the practice of data science, starting with programming fundamentals and progressing through specific advanced skills, all within the statistical programming language, R. In the fundamentals portion of the course, students learn about the fundamentals of R programming, including data typing, conditionals, loops, and functions, before progressing into more advanced basic programming within the tidyverse framework. While learning specific coding skills, students also learn the fundamentals of good software engineering practices, including the use of version control systems, navigation of command shells, iterative development practices, and regular expressions. In the applied skills portion of the skills, students are introduced to variety of specific data science applications, including data visualization, markdown, web scraping, machine learning, natural language processing, supercomputing, and relational databases.\n\npreviously offered as 8960 ",

In a seminar format, the course will examine the current literature on IRT, beginning with current methods for estimating its item response functions, which are the building blocks of IRT, including the methods of marginal maximum likelihood estimation, Markov chain monte-carlo methods, and factor analysis. The research literature on these methods will be evaluated to guide the proper use of the methods for practical application. Other topics to be evaluated in depth will be selected from the following, based on student interest: person parameter estimation, item fit, person fit, local independence, polytomous IRT models, hierarchical models, special models (e.g., response time models), among others.
