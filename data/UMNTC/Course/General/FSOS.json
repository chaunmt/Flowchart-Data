Students will participate in a community project with a community organization that focuses on supporting families. This will enable them to attend community meetings, shadow family/community liaisons, and better understand the interface between families, community organizations, and institutions. Class assignments will allow students to engage in reflective practice and pull learning from their community-based experiences.

These goals will be achieved by using case studies as a starting point to both seek information on the rules and regulations that impact financial decision-making while also provoking reflection on how individual, family, and community assets inform the important decisions that students make in their past, present, and future financial journeys.\n\nThe case studies used throughout the class are drawn from the lives of contemporary college students and reflect the complexity of the emerging adulthood experience: gaining financial independence from their family of origin and engaging with unfamiliar financial systems while still being connected to their families and communities. At the end of the course, students will have a better understanding of how to navigate financial systems, define financial wellness on their own terms, and develop a roadmap that will assist them on their own financial journey throughout college and beyond.\nStudents will analyze a total of seven case studies. Through a combination of in-class, small group, and individual problem-solving experiences, students will explore and apply the content learned in class to discover the connections between financial-decision making and financial wellness. Each of the case studies is designed to emphasize the following core components of good financial decision-making:\n\n1) Recognizing and resolving the influences of financial socializing agents (family, community, culture)\n2) Navigating the rules and responsibilities of dominant-culture financial systems and your role within them\n3) Identifying personal goals and planning for financial wellness for college and beyond\n\nIn-class activities and homework assignments will be designed to provide students the opportunity to \u201clearn by doing.\u201d For the final project, students will demonstrate the transfer of knowledge to skills by preparing their own case study (see assignments for more information).",

An examination of family strengths, cultural diversity, and approaches for working with families across the life course in community based settings including classrooms, programs, and agencies will be emphasized. This course focuses on vulnerable families and those affected by historical and traumatic stress. It covers family members of all ages who face particular challenges, such as intergenerational exposure to traumatic events, persistent and structural inequality, and health disparities. \n\nThis course is designed to increase awareness of the conditions that place families and children at risk, the theories and frameworks available to understand these risks, and both individual and family resiliency to these conditions. The course will primarily focus on  a) individual, family, community, and developmental contexts of risk and resiliency, and b) family-level preventive and intervention frameworks and approaches to support individuals and families.",
