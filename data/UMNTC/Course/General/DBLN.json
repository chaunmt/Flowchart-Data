With that in mind, this intensive practical playwriting course will interrogate the tradition of theatrical writing in the Irish capital of Dublin by engaging comprehensively with a variety of modes and disciplines specific to the act of writing for the Irish stage. Contemporary Dublin has undergone an unprecedented process of modernization rarely seen in the developed world, with the city becoming in just twenty years a multicultural, cosmopolitan space that is embracing provocative ways of seeing and creating work meant for theatrical performance. Questions about the relevancy of the practice of writing in creating performance, how authorship of a play is determined, and the slipperiness of language are now at the heart of Irish theatre?s drive to redefine itself. Challenged by a wide range of disciplinary approaches to writing and rewriting, students will be exposed to a host of methodologies for creating dramatic literature for the stage specific to this unique moment in Irish theatrical history and, in the process, gain an appreciation for the important role writers still play in making theatrical performance.

Before students explore the city, chronologically they will examine ancient Ireland\u2019s globality in terms of its educational and religious influences, particularly on mainland Europe. Then, starting from the 10th Century, students will retrace the Viking city through to the city\u2019s current form that is characterised by urban sprawl, multiculturalism, and its connection to Europe and the global economy. Much of the first half of the course will explore the creation of the colonial city (Georgian Dublin) and, following independence from Britain, the creation of the postcolonial city. Each of these phases in the city\u2019s morphology can be witnessed/read through an examination of the city\u2019s architecture, nomenclature, museums, art, and in relation to the post-colonial city, oral histories, which requires an interdisciplinary toolkit for city exploration and analysis. \n\nThe second section of the course will explore the policies that fostered the rapid speed at which Dublin grew from being a sparsely populated, non-industrial and disconnected urban space in the 1970s to a post-industrial/post-modern relatively highly populated dense plural space in the 1990s. Students will investigate the relationship between these policies and the devastating recession of the 2000s. Students will also explore the result of these rapid physical and socio-economic and cultural changes in terms of gentrification, immigration, and the complicated and contested nature of inner city residents\u2019 notions of place, space, and identity. Students will also explore the creation of new multiethnic spaces and the city\u2019s rebranding as a literary-cultural space (tourist Dublin). Finally, students will investigate the processes that occur in most global cities, which contribute to the creation of invisible spaces and subcultures that are found on the physical and cultural margins.",

These images are believed to have given rise to an attendant Irish way of life that is characterized as religious, relaxed, fun-loving, and welcoming, as well as by the charming leprechaun, crafty peasant, and drunken Irishman. To explore the origins and significance of such popular images, this course will deconstruct the artistic and political \"creation\" of these national stereotypes and how they affect, and are challenged by, contemporary Irish culture and identity, particularly in the wake of recent immigration.\nStudents will read and analyze seminal texts by W.B. Yeats (Cathleen Ni Houlihan) and James Joyce (The Dead) to discuss the creation of Irish imagery and how it is contested over time. These two texts and a short introduction to the creation and remit of the Abbey Theatre will aid a discussion of the explicit influence art has had on Irish politics. Furthermore, students will explore the role of Ireland's national sport (GAA) and the dominant Catholic religion that are paramount to an understanding of the significance of place, space, and community structures in Irish culture. \nTo gain an insight into the impact of historical events and figures and how they are memorialized in contemporary Ireland, students will create Google maps that highlight and discuss the iconography of Dublin's architecture, street names, bridges, monuments, and statues. Students will also explore the contradictions between past and present representations of Irish culture by conducting small research projects on the \"St. Patrick's (day) Festival,\" the \"Festival of World Cultures\" in Dun Laoghaire, Co. Dublin, \"F\u00e9ile an Phobail: Festival of the People,\" in West Belfast and the Rose of Tralee festival in Co. Kerry. This section will include a discussion on Irish music and Riverdance.\nThe Celtic Tiger, the name given to Ireland's unprecedented economic development, and its subsequent effects on the built environment are discussed in parallel with the rapid and contentious transformation of Irish culture from primarily rural to urban. Finally, students will conduct independent group research on sub-cultures and groups that are present but veiled (segregated) in the margins of contemporary Irish society such as the Irish Traveling community, homeless, and immigrants. \nThe course aims to give students the tools and theories necessary to explore culture and identity, which are traditionally aligned to academic fields such as anthropology, ethnography, sociology, geography, and particularly in the case of Ireland, literature. An aim of this course is to give students an appreciation of researching culture and its disciplinary and interdisciplinary applications, as well as an understanding of how similar processes that create a national imagery apply to America.",

    "info": "This course examines the social and cultural development of Ireland from its first human habitation nearly 10,000 years ago through the present. We begin in deep prehistory with the Mesolithic peoples who brought their hunter-gatherer technologies and lifeways to Ireland once the final ice sheets had receded at the end of the Pleistocene. We will proceed through the Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, exploring the many agricultural and cultural changes that occurred during these dynamic periods. In the 5th Century AD, Ireland, unlike the rest of Europe, remained untouched by the Romans. But the coming of Christianity in the mid-5th century was to change life here in uncountable ways. We will examine the real St. Patrick, his life, and his writings. The Vikings arrived in the late 8th century, initially to raid and rob, but gradually began to establish settled centers; they founded Dublin (Dubh Linn), Waterford, Wexford, Cork, and Limerick and helped establish Ireland as an important trading center.\n\nThe Anglo-Normans invaded Ireland in the late 12th century, beginning over 800 years of British occupation on our island. By the 16th century, Henry VIII and his system of Reformation set off yet more unrest in Ireland as the Irish resisted attempts to convert to Protestantism. A long era of conflict then ensued, beginning with the Battle of Kinsale in 1602, the Flight of The Earls in 1607, the Plantation of Ulster in 1610, the Cromwellian invasions in the 1640s, sending Ireland and the Irish into an extended period of economic and social poverty. The time of the great out-migration of the Irish had begun. The Potato Famine\u2014An Gorta M\u00f3r\u2014in the mid-19th Century wiped out 50% of the Irish population between starvation and emigration. The horrors of this, coupled with rising radicalism and political awareness, brought about the Easter Rising of 1916, which eventually led to the formation of the Irish Free State in 1920, the Irish Civil War, and Ireland's final political separation from Britain in 1949. It also led to The Troubles, the 30+ long period of civil strife which, even today after the signing of the Good Friday Agreement in 1998, continues to vex Irish lives north and south.\n\nWe are a very old land but a very young country and we are undergoing enormous economic and cultural changes on the world stage. You are in Ireland during an important and historically significant period of our development as a country and culture. This course will give you the tools and background to observe history unfold before you.",

    "info": "The Global Internship Course (GIC) provides a unique and innovative opportunity for students to engage in an internship (and living abroad experience) while supported by academic in class and online educational sessions to further develop their personal and professional skills while earning academic credit. GIC students also partake in out-of-class guided and self-guided activities and excursions that have been devised to enable students to become more comfortable with, and knowledgeable of, their internship locations/neighbourhoods. Furthermore, a day-long field trip illustrates how socio-political and economic factors, such as the effects of housing costs in global cities, necessitate commuting and changing work practices such as flexible working hours and working remotely that embody best practice in well-being. Field excursions vary and may also include a focus on, for example, corporate social responsibility and sustainability.\n \nThe GIC fits in with CAPA's philosophy and practice of enabling students to learn about the social and cultural context of their internship placement and the host region and country, as well as other GIC themes, through comparative global analysis. At times, this analysis will be facilitated through a small selection of CAPA Masterclasses and our \u201cIn Conversation with:_______\u201d series given by leading professionals from a diverse range of fields. The in-class active learning approach gives students the opportunity to discuss and analyze theories and models of work, organizational behavior and management in a cross-cultural context. COVID-19 has, by necessity, and in time, by choice, increased the extent to which employees work remotely. The GIC will help students to work effectively in a partial and/or, if required, full-time remote capacity should the need arise and to demonstrate to students the competencies and skills that they will gain and demonstrate through remote engagement.\n \nA variety of teaching and learning activities will be used; for example: lecture, workshop, discussion, informal and formal presentations, self-guided and guided research, and mock (recorded) interviews. The assessment mechanisms are all designed to support learning, using the internship and living abroad experience as a vehicle. Above all, the in-class CAPA sessions give students the opportunity to listen to individual experiences, compare and contrast activities with others, and consider the experience in terms of their personal and professional development. At the beginning we focus on self-reflection, and at the end of this process we challenge each student to focus on self-projection. At its core, GIC provides an opportunity for students to unpack, synthesise, and articulate (the value of) their learning.\n \nIt is, therefore, our intention that students will treat these on-site sessions with the same dedication and professionalism that we expect the students to display at their internships. Students will undertake an intensive orientation session to help them prepare for and integrate into their placements. Additional resources and readings to aid students' personal and professional development will be provided. Central to the pedagogy of GIC is self-reflection and collaboration; we value the diverse socio-cultural and academic backgrounds our students bring to the course and see the multi- and interdisciplinary nature of GIC as a plus for discussion and collaboration. Students with prior knowledge of certain topics covered in class are encouraged to share their knowledge in a mentoring capacity with their peers and to build upon their knowledge by considering such topics from other academic disciplines and global and practical perspectives.\n \nThe content of this course is arranged around three key themes: Personal and Professional Development, Intercultural Competence, and Comparative Analysis. \n",

    "info": "Management consulting will continue to be a significant and popular career option as it provides an opportunity for challenging work, continued self-development, access to important social and professional networks, traveling, and financial rewards.\nIn this course, students will explore the art of using expertise in a field to advise client organizations on high-level strategic issues and provide them with management counsel. Throughout the course, students will experience the opportunity to work on solving executive-level problems and simulate consulting project activities and situations by working on business cases, exercises, and a team assignment based on real-life consulting challenges. The class will be taught using a combination of discussion, cases, and guest lectures. The class environment will be highly interactive and participative. The course will culminate with a Team Project Competition, in which students will be organized into 6 consulting teams: Strategy Consulting, IT Consulting, Marketing Consulting, Human Capital Consulting, Operational/Process Consulting, and Organizational Consulting. While elaborating the course project, students will receive coaching and guidance from the professor in two Consulting Labs to provide students with an intensive on-the-job training experience. The consulting proposals will be presented in the last class and will be judged by a guest consultant.\nThe goal of the course is to provide students with a hands-on experience of management consulting. Therefore, students will be taken on a journey departing from experiencing what business consultants do, who they work for, how they spot consulting opportunities, and how they develop proposals, perform business diagnostics, develop solutions, create an effective implementation plan, and skillfully present it to the client. In the process, students will have the opportunity to meet and learn from practicing experts: a management consultant from a large consulting group and an independent consultant, who will be invited to provide information relevant to their firms, their professional experience, and their particular expertise in the profession.",
