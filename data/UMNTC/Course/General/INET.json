You will also learn about the choices you have in becoming an IT/ICT professional. Information Technology (IT), or Information and Communication Technology (ICT), is a growing field that impacts every aspect of life. IT/ICT exists across multiple sectors, which can include broad mandates as well as very niche focuses. There is much that can be learned and many options for honing one?s technical expertise. But regardless of how much one can learn about the technology of IT/ICT, there will always be the human element and interactions that one must engage in as a professional in this world. The course is composed of three sections: (1) personal identity in IT; (2) collaboration in IT; and (3) IT in professional contexts. In short, INET 2001 will introduce you to the IT/ICT industry's culture and skills and prepare you to be a successful student and a productive professional.",

Some of these ways -- for example, in a business or in terms of specific employment activities -- you will study in other courses; INET 3011W asks you to think about the ethical decision-making that goes into ICT activities and their impact within and beyond the ICT world. What ethical choices must individuals make when designing new software or applications? What sorts of problems and competing interests can arise during work in organizational teams or across an industry, and how can they be resolved? More fundamentally, what impact does ICT, along with the ethical decisions made by those working in the field, have on the larger world -- the communities in which it is deployed, the environment on which it operates, and the governments and economies in which it plays an ever-increasing role? To address these and related questions, INET 3011W will require you to examine ICT's impact from three different perspectives: (1) the individual decision-maker; (2) the team or organizational dynamic; and (3) the stakeholders at the social, and even global, level. \n\nprereq: None\n",
