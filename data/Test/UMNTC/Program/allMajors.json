Multidisciplinary in its approach to learning, AA&AS students are exposed to the pressing challenges of the modern world, as well as possibilities for transformations through the study of African American and African history, literature, and culture, and the study of Africa in global perspectives. The courses present students with tools of inquiry from multiple liberal arts disciplines to make known tremendous diversities and overlapping histories and experiences within the wider black world. AA&AS also offers two African languages, Swahili (spoken throughout East, Central, and South Africa) and Somali, in its undergraduate curriculum. The major curriculum consists of three core courses and seven upper-division elective courses. Many AA&AS graduates have not only been accepted to professional and graduate schools, but have also cultivated their career paths in exciting directions including education, business, medicine, law, the arts, journalism, local and transnational advocacy work, and foreign affairs.

Agribusinesses, as well as state, federal, and marketing agencies need individuals who have a broad education in the scientific (and technical) aspects of agriculture, effective work and communication skills, and quantitative and qualitative skills to solve business problems. The scientific knowledge and technical skills necessary to become an effective agribusiness marketing or media professional are provided through requirements in the basic and agricultural sciences and are strengthened by selection of one of three areas of emphasis: crops and soils, food industries, or broad overview of food, agricultural, and environmental sciences. With 21 free-standing elective credits, all majors are encouraged to pursue a CFANS or other minor.",

    "info": "The agricultural education major provides students with a broad understanding of agricultural, food, and natural resource sciences, and opportunity to develop professional educator skills. Professional courses in education and agricultural education prepare students to become effective and successful educators. Experiential learning is emphasized as students spend time in schools applying course concepts, learning from effective educators, and completing a teaching internship as a capstone activity.\n\nWhile the major is focused on teaching school-based agricultural education, graduates are prepared for a variety of careers within the food and agricultural industry. Students are equipped with communication, critical thinking, and interpersonal skills; experience in the teaching and learning process; and a breadth of knowledge of the science and business of agriculture that are in demand by a wide range of employers.\n\nGraduates take positions as agricultural education teachers or youth educators; educational and training specialists for agribusinesses, commodity organizations, extension, and nonprofits; as well as positions in sales, management, and customer relations with agribusinesses.\n\nStudents graduating in agricultural education are in demand by employers, very satisfied in their careers, and earn some of the highest average starting salaries among College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences (CFANS) majors. However, there are not enough graduates to meet the current demand for school-based agricultural education teachers. This demand is predicted to increase in the future, both in Minnesota and across the United States.\n\nStudents are prepared to meet teacher licensure requirements in Agricultural Education (grades 5-12) and Coordinator of Work-Based Learning (grades 9-12). The agricultural education major is a collaborative partnership between the College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences (CFANS) and the College of Education and Human Development (CEHD).",

    "info": "American Studies is an interdisciplinary approach to the study of American Society. The program provides a broad, interdisciplinary approach to the study of critical issues to American society, with an emphasis on deep historical, cultural, and political understandings. Faculty in the program come from a range of fields and have varied expertise.\n\nStudents majoring in American Studies undertake a unique, interdisciplinary study of American society, gaining critical perspectives on past and contemporary issues and topics. They typically pursue their own interests within the very broad range of educational opportunities in the program. Courses offered by the department explore a wide range of topics, including popular culture, politics, migration, religion, history, race, gender, and sexuality, as well as important issues such as America's changing place in the world, foreign policy, the events of 9/11, and economic crises and inequality.\n\nMajoring in American Studies provides an opportunity for students to pursue particular interests while gaining broad training in a variety of topics and interdisciplinary scholarship. The program of study provides opportunities for the development of writing, critical and creative thinking, and research skills, which culminate in the Senior Project. The Senior Seminar is a year-long course of study limited to graduating seniors in American Studies, giving a chance for undergraduates to work closely with the faculty member in developing and undertaking a major research project which serves as the capstone for the undergraduate program. This unique process allows students to use their skills and knowledge to conduct original research or creative work, which reflects their interests and expertise on a particular topic.\n\nIn addition, the Department of American Studies cooperates with the Departments of African-American and African Studies, American Indian Studies, Chicano & Latino Studies, and Asian American Studies, which makes it possible for students to concentrate their studies in one of those cultural areas.\n\nAmerican Studies provides a unique preparation for students interested in an interdisciplinary approach to a particular aspect of American society, while preparing them for careers or further graduate training. The program encourages service learning, internships, and partners with the Minnesota Historical Society to place undergraduates into working on and researching public history. Graduates are well prepared for work in the public and private sector, as well as nonprofit and non-governmental organizations. Current alumni work in a range of fields including education, non-profits, research, historical preservation, journalism, mass media, law, and medicine.\n\nTransfer students interested in American Studies should contact the Department of American Studies to discuss previous coursework, transfer credits, and likely course of study at Minnesota. Students wishing to double major or minor should also contact the department about developing a course of study and graduation plan.",

    "info": "Anthropology is the study of humankind in all of its forms (cultural, biological, and linguistic), using a holistic and global perspective. It comprises four primary subfields: archaeology, biological anthropology, linguistic anthropology, and sociocultural anthropology, all of which are uniquely linked by the concept of culture.  \n\nAnthropology combines a set of theories and methods that have, at their core, the development of an understanding of human biological and cultural variability. It allows students to learn about the scientific, social, political, and historical perspectives on human variation and human evolution. It challenges them to examine their own beliefs, and come to their own conclusions, about the implications in today's world of biological and cultural variation, including how false narratives have been and continue to beperpetuated in order to oppress certain groups. Fundamentally, Anthropology therefore contributes to the liberal education of students at the University of Minnesota by tackling questions that are at the heart of societal tensions: how does identity relate to the biological and cultural factors that have shaped humans as a species, and that continue to shape populations and individuals? Importantly, Anthropology as a reflexive discipline also examines its own legacy.  Many of our classes tackle the impact of colonialism, racism, and other actions and ideologies that serve to justify and perpetuate inequality.\n\nThe Bachelor of Science degree recognizes that many fields of study within biological anthropology and archaeology depend upon modes of inquiry based upon empirical scientific methods. It therefore develops competence in these scientific methods through curricular requirements within and outside Anthropology. Students pursuing this degree are required to take 20-24 credits outside Anthropology in a wide variety of courses within the Quantitative and Natural sciences. Within the major, students take numerous lab-based courses, in which they learn to ask scientific questions, design a research methodology, collect and analyze data, and use the results to refine the question. Non lab-based classes also strongly emphasize research skills, effective writing, and critical thought. \n\nThe BS degree provides an excellent foundation for a wide range of careers in anthropology, such as evolutionary anthropology, molecular anthropology, geo-archaeology, archaeological chemistry, and forensic anthropology.\n\nAdditionally, the BS degree enables students who are pursuing a career in the health sciences to fulfill the math and science prerequisites for medical school and other graduate programs in health, while gaining a solid foundation in anthropology. Although a second language is not required for the BS degree, cultural competency and an appreciation of the role of culture in how societies construct knowledge are gained through anthropological coursework at all levels.\n",

    "info": "Anthropology is the study of human beings and cultures throughout the world during the present and past. It is the study of who we are, and how we came to be that way. Anthropology is partly a natural science, partly a social science, and partly a humanistic study. Anthropology majors compare and contrast the biological, social, and cultural similarities and differences of humans and their societies across the globe and develop a sophisticated understanding of both the cultural diversity and the biological unity of our species. Perhaps more than with any other degree, Anthropology majors are known to possess unique observational and critical thinking skills, and are aware of the role that culture plays in identity, relationships, and decision-making.\n\nStudents who major in the field are expected to take courses in the four sub-fields of anthropology. Students planning a professional career in anthropology general specialize in one of the sub-fields: biological anthropology (the evolutionary history of human and nonhuman primates), archaeology (the study of prehistoric and historic societies through their material culture), sociocultural anthropology (the study of the behavior of recent people in settings that range from unindustrialized societies to modern urban centers), and linguistic anthropology (the comparative study of languages and communication). The Anthropology Department website (http://cla.umn.edu/anthropology/ba-anthropology) offers several examples of course sequences designed to provide training in particular sub-fields. There are a variety of opportunities for graduates with degrees in anthropology. While some go on to graduate school in order to obtain a position in a university, most graduates find non-academic jobs in the private and public sectors. Private industry consulting, environmental firms, product development and marketing firms, as well as the nonprofit sector all employ anthropologists because of the unique observational and critical thinking skills they possess. Governmental agencies at the state and federal levels seek anthropologists for various positions. Biological anthropologists find employment as forensic scientists working for law enforcement. Archaeologists find jobs in cultural resource management (CRM) firms whose services are contracted by construction companies to ensure compliance with legislation pertaining to archaeological and historical preservation. \n\nAn anthropology major is also excellent preparation for professional schools in medicine, public health, nursing, and law. An anthropology major offers a holistic education that, regardless of the job attained after graduation, provides a perspective on humanity that inspires a lifetime of engagement with the issues of importance to our globalized society.",

    "info": "The Department of Anthropology offers graduate education in sociocultural and linguistic anthropology, archaeology, and biological anthropology. The program admits students only for the PhD, although some students do earn a master's degree as part of their PhD program. \n\nMajor areas of faculty research and graduate student training in sociocultural and linguistic anthropology include art and visual culture, critical theory, queer theory, feminist theory, critical disability studies, environment, ecology, and the Anthropocene, cultures of capitalism, language and modernity, colonialism and imperialism, experimental writing, gender, race, and sexuality, medical anthropology, memory and haunting, religion, multi-species ethnography, new materialisms, legal and political anthropology, economic anthropology, anthropology of race and racism, philosophical anthropology, science and technology studies, sovereignty and the state, and temporality and futurity. Regional specializations include Europe, the Pacific, the Middle East, North America, the Caribbean, and East Asia.\n\nThe program in archaeology applies social and ecological theories to produce new anthropological insights into the roles of material culture and the environment in indigenous, prehistoric, and historical contexts. Our archaeologists apply a range of scientific methods in the field and the laboratory to understand human-environmental interactions in the past, and to advance knowledge of landscape use and site formation processes. Regional specializations include Europe, Asia, Latin America, and North America.\n\nThe program in biological anthropology offers training and research opportunities in two main areas: paleoanthropology and molecular anthropology. The paleoanthropology speciality combines biological anthropology, vertebrate paleobiology, and Paleolithic archaeology to interpret the evolution and behavior of hominins and other primates through the application of evolutionary theory to the analysis of skeletal morphology, faunal remains, community analysis, and site taphonomy. The molecular anthropology speciality studies the population history of humans by using ancient DNA and modern genomic methods to investigate processes such as migration, admixture, and adaptation, as well as historic trends in disease and health. Students also benefit from training and expertise in primate behavior and ecology, stable isotope paleoecology, phylogeography, geochronology, and phylogenetic methods through close collaborations and co-advising with faculty in other departments.",

Our students have pursued careers in government and in the private sector using their BS degrees. Others have pursued professional or graduate training in economics, law, management, or public policy.\n\nStudents completing the applied economics major are not eligible to add a second major in agricultural food and business management due to course overlap.\n\nStudents majoring in agricultural and food business management and applied economics cannot minor in either of the department minors (AFBM or APEC).

    "info": "The bachelor of science (with a major in architecture) is a pre-professional architecture degree program that offers studio-based design education and a rigorous program of history/theory and building technology courses. The program exposes students to the formal, socio-cultural, material, environmental, and historical factors that shape built environments. The BS program fosters a sense of stewardship for local and global built environments by providing opportunities for students to engage with College of Design faculty and research centers, to enroll in service learning courses, and to study abroad. Design education in the BS program is structured around five sequential semester-long design studios. Each studio is a focused study in one of architecture's core areas: 1. material assemblies, 2. site and the designed environment, 3. program and typology, 4. metropolitan design, and 5. advanced design. Through hands-on making and complementary courses, students demonstrate how these core areas affect formal, spatial, and experiential qualities of architectural space. \n\nBS students develop visual literacy through design thinking and the development of design processes in design studios by engaging spatial representation in drawing and computational courses, by researching historical precedents and theoretical texts in history and theory seminars, and by exploring concepts of sustainability and resilience in technology courses. The BS program fosters a sense of stewardship of local and global built environments by providing opportunities for students to engage with College of Design faculty and research centers, to engage in design-build activities, to enroll in service learning courses, and to study abroad. \n\nStudents are eligible to apply to the BS degree program from within the College of Design after completing all required first-year courses. Admission is competitive, with a portfolio, transcripts, and an essay included in the application process. Students in the BS will take five required 6-credit design studios, a sequence of history/theory and building technology courses, and 9 credits of upper-level architecture electives. Graduates of the BS are well prepared to apply to the second year of the School of Architecture's master's of architecture graduate program; master's of science degree programs in sustainability, heritage preservation and conservation, and metropolitan design; as well as other graduate degree programs at peer institutions, per their admissions requirements.",

The concerns of architecture involve a wide variety of areas of study, including the art of representing built projects through drawings and computer graphics; the technology of building structure, building materials, and natural and mechanical systems; the history, theory, and art of making, using, and understanding buildings as cultural artifacts for human use; and the practice of architecture in the context of sustainable environmental systems, urban form, and business economics.\n\nThe master's of architecture degree is the accredited three-year professional program that prepares students for licensure and practice in the discipline of architecture as a speculative, analytic, and investigative endeavor. Through rigorous methods of inquirydeveloped in the design studio, lectures, and seminarsstudents acquire the breadth of knowledge required of the professional architect, including: the techniques and processes of representation, communication, and analysis; the history and theory of making architecture and urban form for human use; and the technology, systems, processes, and economics of construction and practice. The 90-credit M.Arch. professional degree program is accredited by the National Architectural Accrediting Board (NAAB). A portfolio for admission is required.\n\nThe M.Arch. program is designed to provide rigorous training in the areas of materials and media literacy, stewardship of the built and natural environment, and systemic, urban-scale thinking. M.Arch. students take required coursework in the areas of design studio, building technology, building structures (statics), structural engineering systems (applications), environmental systems, advanced building technology/integrated building systems, technical applications in design, architectural history, design theory, and catalyst workshops. The required curriculum includes integrated design/technology coursework such as the second year graduate design studio + building structures; a net-positive design studio with a focus on daylighting, solar design, and energy conservation in buildings; an advanced studio focused on urban and landscape systems; a two-part global and cultural history sequence; and a Master's Final Project developed independently by the student. Computer tools and applications as well as analog modes of critical representation are incorporated into the design studio sequence.",

The curriculum emphasizes concepts and methods from economics and business management and their use in identifying, analyzing, and solving management problems related to food, agriculture, natural resources, and economic development. The program provides a balance between applied economics and business management studies, with a limited amount of applied science. Students may elect a variety of courses or minors in their junior and senior years to accommodate special interests and career goals.\n\nGraduates of the curriculum are prepared for a wide range of employment opportunities in the food system and other agribusinesses. Examples of employment areas include finance and banking, management, input, commodity and food marketing, sales, administration, public and industrial relations, production management, economic and statistical analysis, managerial accounting, management information systems, and supply chain management.\n\nStudents completing the program may also pursue graduate studies in preparation for research, teaching, or continuing education positions in academic institutions, government agencies, or industry. \n\nStudents completing the agricultural food and business management major are not eligible to add a second major in applied economics due to course overlap.\n\nStudents majoring in agricultural and food business management and applied economics cannot minor in either of the department minors (AFBM or APEC). We highly encourage students to pursue a University-wide minor or, if they are in AFBM, one of the department-specific minors offered through CSOM.",

Students who earn a BA can double major in journalism to prepare for a career in media or advertising, or in art history to prepare for a curatorial career, or even in business to prepare for a career in non-profit arts management.\n\nThe Bachelor of Arts (BA) degree program in studio art provides training in fine art techniques and theory. Our BA program emphasizes the development of visual awareness and expression through hands-on involvement in the creative process. In the studio courses, BA students will become familiar with the materials and concepts used to understand the nature of visual language and gain a sense of their own aesthetic voice. In theory courses, students gain an appreciation for the scope of art and how art can be a catalyst for societal change.\n\nFaculty in the Department of Art are all active, working artists and thinkers committed to their students and to diversity of students' histories and experiences. The faculty and curriculum encourage students to take risks, to engage with their communities, and prepare students to use the degree in a variety of arts-related careers. The flexibility of this program allows students to double majors or add a minor in fields such as journalism, communications, psychology, and marketing.\n\nGraduates have gone on to work in visual arts, art therapy, non-profit management, advertising, communications and have successfully completed a variety of graduate programs.",

    "info": "Art history is the study of the visual world, both past and present. Starting from the premise that images, objects, and the built environment speak more directly and deeply about a culture than its written records, our courses prepare students to 'read' and respond to the increasingly visual world in which we live. Through the close study of artworks from different times and places, majors acquire a unique understanding of the world and their place within it.\n\nArt history's interdisciplinary curriculum covers the fine arts as well as visual and material culture more broadly defined: from paintings and sculpture to architecture and urban design; from film and photographs to ceramics and textiles; from scientific illustration and posters to performance art and graffiti. Through engaging with these and other forms of visual and material expression, majors develop crucial, transferable skills: visual analysis and interpretation, original research and careful argumentation, image-based thinking and communication, and clear and persuasive writing in a variety of modes.\n\nArt history majors' ability to critically evaluate sources, sharp communication skills, and nuanced understanding of diverse cultures make them natural creative thinkers, storytellers, and community advocates. Thanks to their powerful skill set, students of art history also go on to enjoy higher job satisfaction and lower unemployment rates over the course of their working lives than peers in vocational tracks.\n\nGraduates pursue careers in range of fields: the visual arts (e.g., art criticism, art appraisal and sales, art therapy, museums, and conservation), humanities (e.g., grant writing, historic preservation, and philanthropy), media and marketing (e.g., advertising, film, and journalism), K-12 and post-secondary education (e.g., teaching and administration), information science and collections management (e.g., libraries and archives in non-profit and corporate contexts), as well as medicine and law.\n\nArt history is the history of humanity's creative expression. Majors are therefore asked to fulfill a selection of distribution requirements, which, together, highlight continuities as well as differences across geographic regions and historical eras. To help students gain a more intimate understanding of the important role artistic processes play in knowledge production, the department also requires majors to take one studio art class.\n\nTypically spanning several centuries and continents, 1xxx-level courses provide a broad orientation to art historical topics and debates. 3xxx-level courses are also appropriate for students new to art history, offering introductions to specific subfields (e.g., the history of Chinese painting, the history of photography, etc.). Courses at the 5xxx-level offer more intimate, seminar-style learning experiences, the opportunity to explore focused topics, and pursue individual research under the guidance of faculty experts. Most courses have no prerequisites. This, combined with the total number of required credits, makes art history an especially attractive option for double-majors and transfer students. \n",

The areas do not have to be related to each other, but the program proposal must explain how the areas of study connect to the student's overall educational goals. \n\nWorking closely with a BIS advisor, students develop a written proposal and course list. The proposal must be approved by a committee and three faculty or department advisors with expertise in the areas of concentration. Some departments and colleges have prerequisite or required courses for concentrations based in those departments and colleges in their BIS program.\n\nFor specific information on proposal procedures and on department and college guidelines, see the Individualized Degree Programs website: https://cla.umn.edu/academics-experience/majors-minors/individualized-degree-programs",

Research options are available through BIOC 4994 or BIOC 4794W. Students should consult early with their faculty mentor to begin planning the research component of their major.",

Please contact bthxed@umn.edu for updates.\n\nThe Center for Bioethics offers two kinds of MA degrees: Plan A and Plan B with a major in bioethics. The curriculum for both Plan A and Plan B degrees includes a set of required core courses, bioethics electives, and a requirement for coursework in fields related to bioethics. The Plan A culminates in a substantial, 10-credit master's thesis. In lieu of a thesis, the Plan B culminates in a 4-credit practicum, a 3-credit capstone project and final exam. Electives comprise the additional 3 credits in the Plan B degree.\n\nGraduates of the MA in bioethics greatly enhance their professional opportunities in the field when they combine their bioethics degree with a terminal graduate or professional degree in another field. Examples of degree combinations can include an MA degree in bioethics with a JD, PhD, MD, nursing, or others.  This model of pairing the MA in bioethics with another degree prompts students to acquire a firm disciplinary grounding as well as interdisciplinary bioethics expertise, a practice which best prepares students for the interdisciplinary career options related to bioethics. Some examples of careers  include work in the fields of genetics, social work, public health, veterinary science, religious studies, psychology, biology, and philosophy. ",

The program provides a broad research-based education involving faculty from BMBB, as well as many faculty members from several other departments in CBS, the Medical School, the College of Science and Engineering (CSE), the College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resources Sciences (CFANS), and the College of Veterinary Medicine. \n\nBMBB focuses on determining the molecular mechanisms that underlie basic biological functions using an integrated approach that encompasses biochemistry, chemistry, biophysics, genomics, molecular biology, proteomics, and structural biology. Special emphasis is placed on revealing how biological processes go awry in diseases including cancer, diabetes, heart disease, and AIDS. The program has four areas of emphasis: synthetic biology and biotechnology, molecular biology, metabolic and systems biology, and chemical and structural biology. All students are expected to demonstrate a minimum level of competence in these areas, but will emphasize the area most related to their thesis project. \n\nWhile graduate training in a BMBB laboratory involves first-year coursework and associated preliminary examinations, the focal point for graduate education is thesis research. Laboratory-based exploration coupled with journal clubs, seminars, scientific meetings and retreats, career counseling, and scientific ethics constitutes the major components of the program. Support for graduate education comes from a variety of sources but is augmented by several NIH and NSF-based training grants. Most graduate students from the University of Minnesota obtain full-time employment immediately after graduation, or pursue advanced training in academic or corporate positions.\n\nStudents pursuing a degree in BMBB are only admitted to the PhD program (see note below) under the auspices of Molecular, Cellular and Structural Biology (MCSB), a first-year program administered by BMBB and the Molecular, Cellular, Developmental Biology and Genetics (MCDB&G) graduate programs. After the first year, students select either BMBB or MCDB&G to complete their degree. \n\nNote: One cannot apply for admission to the master's degree in BMBB. Students are only admitted to the BMBB PhD program. Alternative, related master's degree programs that admit students are the master's of biological Sciences (MBS) (http://cce.umn.edu/master-of-biological-sciences) and the master's in microbial engineering (http://bti.umn.edu/MicE/).",

    "info": "As one of the premier graduate tax programs in the nation, the Carlson School's Master of Business Taxation (MBT) program helps students acquire a conceptual understanding of taxation, and develop technical competence in the practical application of the rules of taxation in business. In addition, courses in government and economic tax policy, tax negotiations, and tax technology and analytics provide breadth to complement the technical tax courses. Courses are also designed to develop students' analytical, problem solving, writing and communication skills to enable them to more quickly advance their careers.\t\n\nThe program gives students a chance to learn from world-class faculty who are distinguished professionals with extensive real-life experience. The faculty have in-depth knowledge of the tax industry and work closely with the Twin Cities business community. Combining rigorous coursework and top faculty from the tax community brings a broad perspective into the relationship between tax and business issues, which helps prepare graduates for greater responsibilities in business management and consulting. \n\nHistorically, more than 80 percent of students are employed in the business community and take courses on a part-time basis. All courses are online. The MBT's online courses are asynchronous, divided into weekly modules. They are designed by online learning experts and employ the latest technologies. To free tax professionals from coursework responsibilities during the busiest part of tax season, no courses are offered during the spring semester from early March through April 15. Students enrolled part-time can expect to complete the program in approximately three years. Students enrolled full-time can complete the program in one year.\n",

Chicano-Latino studies majors take courses offered in two broadly defined fields of study, humanities and social science. Humanities content includes courses designed to increase awareness of Chicana/o culture, as well as intellectual, aesthetic, literary, historical, ethical, and human values. Social science content includes courses that analyze social institutions and how they affect the individual, as well as emphasize contemporary Chicana/o issues as they relate to the larger society. Areas of study include political science, anthropology, economics, sociology, and history. The bachelor of arts degree in Chicano-Latino studies is designed to meet the needs of students preparing for careers serving Chicana/o-Latina/o constituencies and to prepare students for graduate and advanced professional study in programs in which a minority affairs focus would be an asset. The program allows students the flexibility of pursuing work in related fields, such as Latin American studies, Spanish studies, Women's studies, and American studies. Double-majors are encouraged.",

    "info": "Civil engineering deals with the science and art of engineering applied to solving problems and designing systems related to infrastructure and the environment. Civil engineers analyze, design, and supervise the construction of roads, buildings, water supply systems, airports, tunnels, dams, bridges, and wastewater treatment systems. They must consider many factors in the design process including regulations and policy issues, sustainability, fabrication costs and constructibility, expected lifetime of a project, and risk assessment of natural events and potential hazards. \n\nCivil engineering is a broad area of engineering and has a tangible impact on the quality of life, human health, and safety. The advances that civil engineers have made in providing clean water supply systems have had a greater impact on human health and longevity than many advances in the medical field. The structures we live and work in, the roads and bridges we drive on, the clean water we drink, and wastewater treatment systems we use, are all designed by civil engineers. Major specialties within civil engineering include construction, environmental, geotechnical, municipal, structural, transportation, and water resources engineering. \n\nCivil engineering jobs are available in both the private and public sector through consulting firms and in government agencies at the local, state, and federal levels. Employment can be found in nearly any region, from small communities and remote areas to the largest cities in the world. Graduates of the program have worked on the design of the tallest building and largest dams in the world. Civil engineering is considered to have one of the highest levels of job satisfaction of all professions. Civil engineers can enjoy a fulfilling technical career and also have opportunities for administrative and leadership positions. Many opportunities are available that allow civil engineers to spend time outdoors. The infrastructure required to sustainably maintain modern society ensures the continued demand for civil engineers. \n\nThe upper division civil engineering program requires students to take introductory courses in the major areas. In addition, students may emphasize in an area by selecting appropriate technical electives in consultation with their advisor. The infrastructure required to sustainably maintain modern society ensures the continued demand for civil engineers.\n\nThe program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org.",

The design process for almost every electronic system includes the specification and development of the control program for the system's microprocessor. A particular computer engineering job can be more closely related to hardware or software, to functional design or detailed design. The Bachelor of Computer Engineering degree provides the background necessary for persons, with continuing study, to work in many computer engineering subfields. The bachelor's degree itself does not, however, provide highly specialized knowledge in any particular subfield.\n\nThe program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org.",

The program prepares students for a variety of industrial, governmental, and business positions involving the use of computers, or for graduate work in the field.\n\nThe Computer Science B.A. is a good fit for someone who wants to learn Computer Science + X. It allows room to explore another area of study when compared the technical course heavy Computer Science BS program. The B.A. includes a richer set of elective credits than the B.S. For application areas that involve the liberal arts, this broader background may be more appropriate. The B.A. may also be a more efficient option for students pursuing a double major or a large minor to stay on track for a four-year graduation.",

After completing a required set of fundamental courses, students arrange their subsequent work around one of several upper division tracks within either computer science or an interdisciplinary area involving computer applications. The degree prepares students for graduate work or for various industrial, governmental, and business positions involving the use of computers.\n\nThe B.S. more upper division credits in computer science and related areas allowing the student to pursue more deeply a particular area of computer science and tailor the degree to a specific area of interest. For students who are more likely to practice in an area that is highly specialized or technical, the B.S. may provide a better background than our B.A. in Computer Science.",

A multidisciplinary faculty of dental educators, researchers, and clinicians teach the program, which is housed in the School of Dentistry. All students complete core coursework in teaching and evaluation of dentistry, research methods, and health care administration. Additional advanced coursework is offered in these same focus areas, as well as in selected clinical and oral science topics with multidisciplinary impact, including conscious sedation, craniofacial pain, geriatrics, oral biology, oral medicine and radiology, oral pathology, practice administration, and psychology. Students have flexibility in planning individualized programs to accommodate their specific areas of interest, and courses from other disciplines may be included for credit in the major area.\n\nStudents enrolled in an advanced clinical dental training program may be admitted to the dentistry graduate program for concurrent study, but must carefully plan their curriculum with their faculty adviser and the director of graduate studies so that their residency and M.S. programs are appropriately integrated and satisfy University registration requirements. Programs in the School of Dentistry that may enroll students for the MS degree include: General Practice Residency, Endodontics, Geriatrics, Orthodontics, Pediatric dentistry, Periodontics, Prosthodontics and Orofacial Pain",

Our courses examine the ways global cultural and artistic practices reflect and transform modes of knowing, of feeling, of acting politically, and underpin conceptions of both individual and collective social identity. The CSCL curriculum covers a wide range of media and art forms, from literature, to cinema, popular culture, music, and the visual arts. The department places a particular focus on the power of ideas; we like to think about how abstract questions in philosophy and theory address concrete problems in our material world.\n\nCSCL strives for a broad, international scope, and ranges widely across history and geography. We aim to produce critical, thoughtful, and well-rounded citizens prepared to work in a wide range of careers from media and journalism to academia, law, politics, medicine, non-profit work in schools, libraries, archives, museums, and community organizations, to advertising, business, entertainment, and other creative fields. Many of our graduates are path-breaking intellectuals, artistic innovators, and committed participants in social struggles that will shape our collective future.",

The coherence of the program lies in its intellectual focus on cognition. This program spans cellular, behavioral, and psychological levels of scientific analysis in the study of cognition in a single unified graduate program. It integrates the diverse content, methods, and perspectives of a number of different disciplines (e.g., anthropology, biology, artificial intelligence, linguistics, neuroscience, philosophy, and psychology), which are concerned with, or in some sense inform, our understanding of cognition. The PhD program trains cognitive scientists to conduct research integration methodologies and content knowledge from a variety of approaches. In order to ensure an interdisciplinary approach, each student has two co-advisors from the cognitive science graduate faculty, each representing a different discipline from within the cognitive sciences.",

Ecology examines the growth and maintenance of populations and their interactions in communities, and relationships among organisms and physical events in terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. Evolution investigates the origin and change of biological diversity by studying evolutionary patterns and processes at various temporal and spatial scales. Behavioral biology explores behavioral adaptations to the environment, mechanisms of behavior, and the evolution of social systems.\n\nA BS in EEB prepares students for graduate study in integrative biology and related biological sciences, careers in teaching, and entry-level scientist positions in industry, government agencies, nonprofit agencies, and universities.",

At the same time, the department maintains the core concerns of the disciplinethe traditional study of the literatures and languages in Englishas well as develops writers for the present and future through the master of fine arts in creative writing degree. The department is engaged in two simultaneous projects: to preserve the core curriculum and to re-imagine its future shape.\n\nThe department offers a master of arts in English language and literature.

Environmental health researchers and professionals seek to understand how to evaluate exposures that create risk to human health, how those exposures elicit biological responses that lead to disease and injury, and how policy is developed and used to prevent adverse health effects. Environmental Health at the University of Minnesota offers master's and doctoral degrees, conducts research in diverse areas of environmental health, offers continuing education, and conducts outreach. Students are prepared to be leaders in environmental health in academia, industry, consulting groups, and government agencies. The program's training and research emphasizes the importance of translating basic scientific knowledge into solutions for current societal problems and concerns. \n\nThe MS program offers a generalist concentration, and environmental chemistry concentration, and a specialized track in industrial hygiene. The Industrial Hygiene track is accredited by ABET.\n\nThe School of Public Health is accredited by the Council on Education for Public Health (CEPH).\n\n",

    "info": "Food science applies chemistry, microbiology, and engineering to the science and technology of developing healthy, safe, convenient, and innovative food products with extended shelf life. Chemistry is a major component in food science because foods and their constituents undergo chemical reactions and interactions during thermal treatment, processing, refrigeration, freezing, storage and in the presence of unique additives or microbes. These chemical reactions and interactions impact flavor, texture, shelf life, and overall consumer acceptability. Microbiology is also key to the food science discipline. Food processing may involve the use of microorganisms as in the production of bread, cheese, yogurt, sauerkraut, and tempeh. On the other hand, control of spoilage and pathogenic microorganisms is important to extend a product's shelf life, ensure safety, and prevent foodborne outbreaks. Physics, mathematics, and engineering are applied in food science because foods must be prepared on a large scale utilizing various mechanical and automated procedures to ensure safety and product consistency. In the food science major, students also learn about sensory/consumer science, packaging, nutritional labeling, analytical procedures, as well as government regulations. The food science program is offered through the College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences.",

    "info": "The Ph.D in Feminist Studies is designed to help students develop a high level of competence in feminist theories, research methods, interdisciplinarity, and pedagogies. Our graduates demonstrate a high level of competence in interdisciplinary feminist theories, research methods, and pedagogies. Our graduate program provides a rigorous interdisciplinary education designed to develop well-prepared scholars in the field of feminist studies and gender, women, and sexuality studies. Feminist studies PhD students pursue general and specialized courses in feminist studies while conducting scholarly research and analysis that truly drives change. Our graduate students are scholars, teachers, and activists, bringing to their work remarkable intelligence and a commitment to analyzing how power operates in and across societies, economies, and cultures. To guarantee a high level of interdisciplinary exchange, the program is designed to bring feminist studies doctoral students together with graduate minor students who are pursuing a disciplinary specialty in their own home department. Along with feminist studies, the contribution of queer and trans* studiesin regard to gender, sexuality, and biological bodiesis also a central component of our graduate program. We offer a wide variety of courses, with emphases in:\n            \n- Critical race and transnational feminisms\n        \n- Social movements\n    \n- Critical gender and sexualities, trans*, and queer studies\n                                                 \n- Feminist ethnography and geography\n                                     \n- Feminist health, medicine, and science studies  \n                                                   \n- Intersections of race, ethnicity, and nationalism \n",

    "info": "When you think of French, does your mind fill with stereotypical images of culture and language? You likely know that French is spoken on 5 continents and is the sixth most-commonly spoken language in the world. Studying French and Francophone Studies at the University of Minnesota takes you far beyond the stereotypes and basics. The major in French and Francophone studies introduces students to world cultures and history, preparing them for our interconnected, global future. The program cultivates students' cultural sophistication and their skills in language, communication, analysis, and argument. It opens doors, strengthens skills vital to today's careers, and helps you to think about many interesting questions and topics in ways you likely have not before.\n\nA major in French combines beautifully with almost any other major on campus. Recent research shows that employers prefer to hire employees who have double-majored, as it often leads to more innovative thinking skills, making you more marketable. French complements many CLA majors, reinforcing the kinds of skills Liberal Arts degrees are rightly heralded for, or it can help develop parallel skills to majors in other colleges (Business, Science, Agriculture, Design), where critical thinking and communication skills can work together with analytical and practical skills developed from the other discipline. We have seen the vast majority of our majors be double majors, and go on to successful careers in international fields, as well as in education, law, medicine, business. These students choose French as a second major, rather than a minor, because it allows them to reach a higher level of language proficiency while achieving a depth of cultural understanding that is not possible in the shorter program.\n\nStudents who come into our department will quickly discover that this idea of combining disciplines is well-entrenched in our faculty and course offerings, which sets us apart from many language departments which focus more on traditional approaches to the discipline. While well-versed in traditional notions of language and culture, with admirable command of the language, its pedagogy and literatures, our faculty are deeply committed to research in fields such as film and the moving image, genocide studies, representations of the body, disability studies, gender and queer studies, migration, and more. Courses cover not only the French language and cultures of Europe, but also of Africa and North America. Elective courses reflect this variety of interests, allowing our students to develop curiosity and knowledge about a wide variety of relevant and current avenues of thought.\n\nSome nuts and bolts: Students must complete FREN 1501/2, and at least four 3xxx-level courses totaling 12 credits, on the UMN TC campus. They can transfer a great deal of coursework from study abroad. We accept appropriate coursework (agreed upon with a departmental advisor before going abroad) from our Montpellier programs, the Senegal MSID program, and others. The majority of our majors do study abroad, if even just in a shorter-term summer program, and these experiences are almost always a life highlight.",

    "info": "From climate to culture, urban settings to rural land uses, human society to environment, the B.S. in Geography provides students with the tools to understand our world, its processes, and all of its inhabitants. The Geography B.S., with its emphasis on the application of scientific knowledge and critical thinking to a wide variety of contemporary geographic problems, is an exceedingly relevant degree. Students specialize in one of two areas, Environmental Geography or Geographic Information Science (GIS). In Environmental Geography students study natural environments and systems, both in themselves and as they relate to human beings, including weather and climate patterns, climate change, plant and animal distributions, forest fires, and natural resources such as water, wind, and forestland. GIS collects geographic information, creates spatial analytical methods, and uses cutting-edge technologies to advance our knowledge of natural and societal phenomena and processes across space and time. Environmental Geography and GIS are highly employable fields that offer opportunities to study some of the most urgent problems facing society today: How do humans affect the climate? Why are climate-change impacts not the same everywhere? What places are most prone to fire, flooding and other hazards, and why? In a city with many different people and many different needs, where is the best place to locate a new hospital or school? How should electoral boundaries be drawn to ensure fair representation? How can we ensure that everyone has access to the goods and services they need or reduce spatial disparities? A B.S. in Geography provides the fundamental knowledge and analytical skills to tackle these and many other fundamentally geographic questions.\n \nThe B.S. in Geography directly benefits from being a science field located in a liberal arts department. As noted by the U.S. National Academies, the liberal arts are of increasing importance in scientific and technical fields because they train students to think broadly and in an integrative way. Geography majors at the University of Minnesota report high rates of satisfaction with the major. The B.S. in Geography supports students in connecting the sciences and the liberal arts by including a broad palette of coursework in Geography such as urban geography, economic geography, and social-cultural geographies. The capstone experience, taken near the end of the student's studies, readies students to move forward by encouraging them to synthesize what they have learned.\n \nA wide variety of career options are open to students with a B.S. in Geography. Local, regional, and federal agencies seek geographers for city and regional planning, natural resource management, transportation, and community development positions. Private industry consulting, environmental and marketing firms, the non-profit sector, and local, national, and transnational non-governmental organizations seek the geographic skills taught in the Geography B.S. Many Geography undergraduate majors obtain careers in education and many go on to graduate school.",

    "info": "The B.A. in Geography answers the need in our society for an integrated, critical understanding of the world's peoples, cultures, and societies, as well as its environments and landscapes, natural and human made -- at every scale from neighborhoods and cities, to nations, regions, and the world as a whole.  Many contemporary issues are fundamentally geographic. Why are there social and spatial inequalities in the world's cities and regions? What roles do geographies of social difference around race, class, ethnicity, and gender play in constructing and resisting power structures in society at large? Why does it make sense to view cultural practices like music or tourism as contested traditions in which geographic difference matters? What new relationships are forming around climate change and human and ecological health? Why is it important to understand struggles over the meaning of common lands and other natural resources? Why does climate change vary from place to place? What are the local vulnerabilities to flood hazards or the local prospects for renewable wind energy? \n\nGeography is a way of seeing which has unparalleled applicability in the world today. It is a meeting place for the study of social, political, cultural, and environmental changes, as these occur in cities, regions, countries, and globally. Students majoring in Geography or adding it as a double major can build an area of expertise matching their interests and imparting knowledge and skills to move them forward in their desired professional trajectory. With the assistance of our Undergraduate Advisor students choose courses to develop a theme in the major: in Urban Geography students focus on the social-spatial processes and patterns that result from human beings living in cities, including cities themselves as expressions of collective human life. In Environment, Health and Society, attention is drawn to the intersection between the human and natural world and the way those intersections impact human life, human health, and the natural world. In Economy and Development Studies the emphasis falls on the economic relationships and power differentials among different parts of the world.  Environmental Geography specializes in the scientific study of natural processes and systems from the perspective of the physical and biological sciences. In Geographic Information Science (GIS), students learn how to use different spatial software packages to use quantitative and qualitative data to analyze and visualize issues of geographic importance.\n\nThe Geography B.A. incorporates all of CLA's career competencies and prepares students for numerous career paths. Geographers have found a place in the for profit and non-profit sectors, in land use and natural resource planning agencies and departments at all levels of government, and more. Many Geography majors have become teachers or been accepted to graduate programs.",

    "info": "Geoengineers solve problems and design systems with, on, and in geological materials, while at the same time protecting the environment. For example, they learn how to evaluate a site on which a tunnel, dam, or road might be built. Geoengineers are involved with (a) geotechnical site investigation and characterization; (b) rock and soil slope stability analysis; (c) groundwater studies and engineering, natural and manmade hazard investigations, and (d) exploration and development of fossil fuel and mineral deposits. They interact with civil engineers to design foundations and retaining walls. Geoengineers prospect for minerals, building material resources, and drinking water. They carry out hazard and risk assessments and mapping for landslides, and they are responsible for environmental assessments or clean-up activities where pollution has occurred. They discover ways to protect the earth while still engineering systems needed for the well being of society. \n\nThe program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org.",

Research focuses on the use and development of discrete and continuum theories such as elasticity, plasticity, fracture mechanics, and poroelasticity for solving engineering problems. Numerical methods are being developed for obtaining solutions; experimental methods and novel apparatus are being developed for gathering physical evidence. Applications include processes of comminution, flow of granular materials, hydraulic fracturing, and nondestructive testing. \n\nThe MGeoE typically takes 2-3 semesters (12-18 months) to complete on a full-time basis or 6-8 semesters on a part-time basis. Students who intend to proceed to the PhD, or who think they may later wish to be admitted to the PhD, should apply for the Geoengineering MS program.\n\n",

An emphasis is placed on visual components: how humans communicate, perceive, interpret, and understand visual information. The program fosters flexibility, which enables graduates to adapt to social, cultural, and technological change in graphic design. The program's foundation is broadly based. Students begin with courses in fundamental aspects of visual studies. Upper division courses prepare them for graphic design positions in print and electronic media. An internship of 1 to 3 credits is required.",

    "info": "At this critical moment, there are few majors more important to understanding the past, navigating the present, or imagining the future than history. History majors make sense of the world through the study of ancient times, the recent past, and everything in between. History majors are detectives, analysts, critical thinkers, and storytellers. Asking interesting questions about the past and examining a range of oral, written, visual, and material sources, history majors explore and explain how peoples across time and space have lived, loved, built community, warred, reconciled, and made sense of their worlds. Deep analysis invites new understandings of the past and the peoples, movements, ideas, technologies, and organisms propelling change. As much as history is a window into the past, it also helps us understand ourselves, our identities, and how we have come to inhabit the moral, ethical, social, economic, political, religious, national, environmental, ethnic, racial, gender, and sexual communities we live in today. History helps us understand how our present and possible futures grow out of a very usable and interesting past. \n\nHistory majors develop all of the skills required to thrive in today's world from an understanding of the engines of change and an ability to assess and interpret conflicting evidence and arguments, to robust oral and written communication skills that will allow you to shape the conversations in your professions and communities. History majors bring powerful skill sets into the world and many go into the legal and medical professions, become business people or scientists, are journalists and teachers, work in the civil or foreign service, run for office, or work in the arts or non-profit sector. Regardless of your career path, a history major will enable you to bring a fresh and critical historical perspective to the communities you live and work in. Historical thinking strengthens communities by encouraging them to think deeply about where they have come from and where they would like to go. This is an incredible time to declare a history major. \n\nMany history majors are double majors. A history major is well paired with the study of political science, economics, sociology, psychology, global studies, journalism, education, foreign languages, biology, math, and engineering. History is a very popular double major due to the broad range of courses offered by our faculty. Students are invited to study local, national, comparative, and global histories, which fascinate them and frequently provide the type of deep contextualization that complements other areas of study.",

It is rooted in key concepts from the social and behavioral sciences and business, such as organizational behavior and theory, labor market analysis, leadership, and strategy. Quantitative analysis of employment problems and issues are also included. Master's candidates are encouraged to choose electives to support a generalist orientation with key business knowledge.\n\nMHRIR offers both full and part-time options.",

Its focus is providing for human welfare by improving the quality of life and protecting human health and safety through design of the interior environment. Students study fundamentals, theory, process, communication, research, and technology to identify and solve problems related to people and their use of interior space. They analyze human behavior to determine a client's functional, aesthetic, social, and psychological needs. They design various types of interiors, such as hospitals, offices, schools, residences, restaurants, hotels, and entertainment facilities. \n\nTo do this, students acquire:\n A foundation in basic design; \n Understanding of the relationship between individuals and their environments;\n Understanding of the contextual relationship of the site, the building, and its systems to the interior;\n Knowledge of regulations that govern their practice of interior design;\n The ability to research user needs and apply findings to problem identification and solution;\n Understanding of historical precedent and contemporary design theories;\n Technical knowledge and communication skills;\n Understanding of business issues and professional ethics; and\n A sense of responsibility to society, especially in the use of resources.",

    "info": "This broad, interdisciplinary field studies Jewish history and cultures from biblical antiquity to the present. The diverse quality of Jewish civilizations and the unifying forces of religion and language offer ample material for the study of continuity, adaptation, and change.\n\nThe undergraduate program offers courses in Hebrew Bible, Second Temple Judaism, the origins and foundational texts of rabbinic Judaism, Jewish history in the ancient, medieval, and modern worlds, Jewish literature, Jewish philosophy, the Holocaust, modern Israel, and the Jewish presence in popular culture. The program has links with the Departments of Classical & Near Eastern Studies, Sociology, History, Spanish & Portuguese Studies, French & Italian Studies, English, German, Nordic, Slavic & Dutch, Political Science, and the School of Music. The University's Center for Holocaust and Genocide Studies also offers courses related to the Nazi Holocaust and its aftermath.\n\nJewish studies majors acquire marketable skills in critical analysis, research, and writing that are applicable across all disciplines and in a variety of professions. In addition, majors gain cross-cultural awareness and sensitivity that is sought after in the workplace, as well as a historical awareness of the complexities that define the modern world. Jewish studies majors have access to undergraduate research opportunities and receive assistance in identifying internships and other professionalizing activities.",

IDIM program proposals must be approved by a committee and three faculty or department advisers with expertise in the areas of concentration. Some departments have established guidelines for students who wish to include concentration areas based in those departments. \n\nFor specific information on proposal approval procedures and department guidelines, see the individualized degree programs website at https://cla.umn.edu/academics-experience/majors-minors/individualized-degree-programs",

    "info": "Landscape architecture is the design discipline concerned with the design, planning, and management of the land. Landscape architects use their knowledge of natural and infrastructural systems to create, plan, and preserve landscapes for human use, ecological function, and climate resilience. Landscape architects regularly work with other disciplines in this pursuit such as architects, civil engineers, urban planners, ecologists, and geoscientists, among others. The Bachelor of Landscape Architecture program prepares students for this field through courses focused on design and creativity, technology, socio/cultural and ecological systems, as well as theoretical and scientific knowledge bases. The eight semester curriculum will further prepare students for the professional practice of landscape architecture, which includes site design/development, urban design/planning, regional planning, and the design of climate resilient and sustainable landscapes across a broad range of types and scales. The program prepares graduates for entry into professional practice or pursuit of advanced study in landscape architecture or related disciplines.\n",

    "info": "The Master of Landscape Architecture (MLA) is a first-professional degree for students who wish to become licensed landscape architects. The MLA program (MLA I) is an interdisciplinary three-year, 89-credit degree accredited by the Landscape Architecture Accreditation Board (LAAB). The curriculum introduces students to the practice and discipline of landscape architecture, providing them with the knowledge, methods, and skills required to practice as landscape architects. Our MLA program prepares students to analyze the complex challenges facing urban, suburban, and rural communities and to envision sustainable designs at multiple scales across human and ecological systems. These challenges include water scarcity and water quality, climate change, species extinction, riverine flooding, and environmental injustice. Students address these challenges through planning and designing interventions that create resilient landscapes that manage increasingly scarce social and natural resources. Our urban location and proximity to the Mississippi River and Great Lakes region enables students to explore landscape change across a wide range of physical and political jurisdictions and to learn from the work of local experts to shift environmental, economic, planning, and development policies and practices to create more just, healthy, and sustainable communities.\n\nLandscape architecture is rooted in ethical notions of “good” and “right” and landscape architects are legally bound to serve “the public good.” Throughout our coursework, students consider the often conflicting values that underlie the built environment. For instance, in Landscape History we ask how places are shaped and reshaped over time in response to cultural, political, environmental, and economic shifts and why certain landscapes are considered historically significant. In research methods, we ask whose knowledge counts when it comes to land use decision-making. In planting design and ecology courses we ask what is “natural” or “native” and do we mean by “restoration.” The core of the MLA includes six design studios that are supported by courses in construction technologies and materials, planting and ecology, media and representation (including geographic information systems), history, and research methods. The studio sequence begins with small-scale local sites where intensive field investigations are critical to the design process. Second- and third-year option studios travel outside the state to investigate issues like climate change and sea-level rise, remediation of polluted sites, and restoration of ecological function. The program culminates in the capstone studio where students develop and research projects on the topic of their choosing.\n\nMLA students are encouraged to explore minors (Ecological Restoration) or dual degrees including the MLA/M. Arch, the MLA/Masters in Public History, or the MLA/Masters of Urban and Regional Planning. Applicants with accredited professional baccalaureate degrees in landscape architecture or architecture will be considered for the MLA II degree. The MLA II requires a minimum of 58 credits of design studio, research methods, and elective courses.",

    "info": "The Master of Science in Management of Technology is a 21-month, executive-format program that integrates the fields of technology and management and provides working engineers, scientists, and other professionals with the knowledge and skills needed to become successful technology leaders and innovators across all business, engineering, and industry sectors. The curriculum emphasizes the application of engineering principles in courses that cover technology management, business foundations, and leadership. Key topics included in technology management are emerging technologies, technology foresight and forecasting, engineering new products and services, project and program management, intellectual property protection, digital transformation, and technological and engineering innovation. In the business foundations category, the curriculum includes accounting, finance, marketing, and strategic planning and decision makingstudents learn relevant concepts, formulae, and analytical models in these. The leadership category includes courses on communications, team dynamics, organizational effectiveness, and conflict management.\n\nStudents advance through the program as a cohort, taking a prescribed sequence of courses together. Case studies, class discussions, and study-group interaction stimulate the learning process. Students also participate in an international residency with a focus on visiting engineering and technology companies. The program culminates in individual capstone projects, in which students prepare data- and analysis-supported recommendations for new products to develop, markets to pursue, manufacturing and engineering processes to launch, and other imperatives.\n\nThe program is offered in a format designed for full-time working professionals. Many students receive some level of corporate financial support. Students take courses one day per week on alternating Fridays and Saturdays and complete the degree within two years.\n",

Regarded by many as the foundation of the biosphere, microbes were likely the first form of life on earth, predating plants and animals by more than three billion years. Microbiologists study the role of microbes, such as bacteria, fungi, and viruses in our world. A key goal of microbiologists is to find new ways to use microbes to our advantage, such as engineering bacteria to synthesize cancer drugs or clean up toxic waste sites.  \n\nThe microbiology major prepares students for advanced work in graduate programs in microbiology and related fields and serves as preparation for careers in the health sciences. Microbiologists find employment in a variety of governmental, industrial, and pharmaceutical fields.",

Students perform brief rotations in faculty laboratories to choose an independent project, and tailor their coursework to support and complement their research. Projects can span modern basic microbiology, applied industrial engineering, as well as include computer science and informatics disciplines. After graduation, many students choose to continue on to a PhD program in a related discipline or work directly in biotechnology research and development. Supporting courses are chosen from fields including biochemistry, microbiology, food science, genetics and cell biology, and computer science. The program is coordinated by the BioTechnology Institute (BTI) and involves faculty from 10 departments and 5 institutes of the University.",

Areas of specialization include membranes, receptors, membrane transport, cell interactions, macromolecular structure, extracellular matrix, cytoskeleton, cell motility, regulation of gene expression, neuroscience, developmental mechanisms, human genetics, plant cell and molecular biology, genetic mechanisms, and genomics.\n\nThe program is interdisciplinary and involves faculty from several departments in the College of Biological Sciences, the Medical School, and the College of Food, Agricultural and Natural Resource Sciences. Institutes for human genetics, plant molecular genetics, biological process technology, genome engineering, stem cell research, and a center for developmental biology provide opportunities for graduate study.\n\nPhD students are admitted to MCDB&G under the auspices of Molecular, Cellular and Structural Biology (MCSB), a first-year program administered by the MCDB&G and the Biochemistry, Molecular Biology and Biophysics (BMBB) graduate programs. After the first year, students select either MCDB&G or BMBB to complete their degree. MCDB&G does NOT have a freestanding master's program.\n\nThe MCDB&G PhD is also part of three joint degree programs: The Joint Degree Program in Law, Health, and Life Sciences, the MD/PhD program, and the MS Genetic Counseling/MCDBG PhD Program.\n\nThe Joint Degree Program in Law, Health, and Life Sciences is unique in the nation and enables students to combine a JD degree with a PhD or MS degree. Students entering this program must be admitted to both the MCDB&G program and the Law School. Admission qualifications for MS and PhD students are identical; only the student's career objectives distinguish the degree that they pursue.\n\nThe MD/PhD program emphasizes the integration of the two major components of training--medicine and research--to ensure excellence in both. The program features a special curriculum that facilitates the transition from Medical School to the first year of formal graduate training and the transition from graduate training back to Medical School.\n\nThe PhD/MS in genetic counseling program emphasizes the integration of  clinical genetics and research--to ensure excellence in both. The program features a special curriculum that facilitates the transition from the first year of formal graduate training and the transition from graduate training in genetic counseling back to Medical School. Students need to apply to both programs and be accepted by both admission committees. ",

    "info": "The BA program is for students who wish to major in music within a broad liberal arts degree program. Students gain a solid foundation in music and join a vibrant community of students with an astonishingly diverse range of interests. BA majors are assigned to a faculty advisor based on their interests in music and career goals. Together they develop an appropriate trajectory of course selections that support the student's aspirations in the study of music and career objectives.\n\nStudents who pursue the music BA choose to specialize in one of two sub-plans: academic emphasis or applied emphasis.\n \nApplied Emphasis (see sample plan)\nThe BA in music with applied emphasis is for students seeking a liberal arts degree that embraces both applied study on a primary instrument in lesson and ensemble courses with the flexibility of elective coursework and foundational studies in music theory, musicology, keyboarding. This degree affords students the opportunity to hone performance skills and gain an increased knowledge of applied pedagogy. This emphasis requires a School of Music entrance application and audition.\n\nAcademic Emphasis (see sample plan)\nThe BA in music with an academic emphasis is designed for students who want a liberal arts education with significant rigor in the academic study of music. Students will focus on music theory, music history, world music, and choose a program concentration in an academic music field. While emphasis does not require a School of Music entrance audition, students need to complete a brief Statement of Interest after meeting with a School of Music during the major declaration process in order to be paired with a faculty advisor.\n\nProgram Advising\nDue the nuances unique to the discipline and study of music, students must work in close consultation on a semesterly basis with the department advisor to ensure adequate and timely degree progress. Music programs involve careful sequencing of core courses and applied music study to progressively build musical competencies and techniques. Introductory courses support not only the key concepts needed for success in the next course in the sequence but also the adjacent core course sequences as well. For example, the music history sequence is highly dependent on the concepts addressed in the accompanying courses in music theory, ear-training, sight-singing, and keyboarding\n",

    "info": "The B.Mus. in performance is a professional degree in which music courses make up approximately 75 percent of the program. The performance major is a professional degree program for musicians wishing to pursue in-depth study and practice in one of six sub-plans: classical guitar; harp; organ; piano; strings; woodwind, brass, percussion; and voice. \n\nStudents study one-on-one with studio faculty on a weekly basis developing both solo and group performance expertise on their individual instruments, which is further provided in chamber coaching and group ensemble work. Performance majors supplement their applied music study with courses that develop their comprehensive musicianship through theory and ear training, musicology, conducting, and upper-division writing.\n\nProgram Advising\nDue the nuances unique to the discipline and study of music, students must work in close consultation on a semesterly basis with the department advisor to ensure adequate and timely degree progress. Music programs involve careful sequencing of core courses and applied music study to progressively build musical competencies and techniques. Introductory courses support not only the key concepts needed for success in the next course in the sequence but also the adjacent core course sequences as well. For example, the music history sequence is highly dependent on the concepts addressed in the accompanying courses in music theory, ear-training, sight-singing, and keyboarding.\n\n",

    "info": "The degree in music education is offered with two concentrations: \n\nInstrumental/General Music  view sample plan\nThe instrumental sub-plan is for students interested in teaching band, orchestra, or general classroom music for K12 students in the state of Minnesota. Students in this major will pursue coursework in instrumental techniques, methods and conducting, applied instrumental courses, and will participate in band or orchestra and a jazz or similar ensemble. \n\nChoral  view sample plan for Piano or Vocal Emphasis\nThis sub-plan is for students who want to teach choral and classroom music at the elementary and secondary level. Completion of this degree program meets licensure requirements for teaching choral and general classroom music for K12 in the state of Minnesota. Piano emphasis students will take courses in applied piano, general music, basic and choral conducting, pedagogy, style and diction, and voice. Vocal emphasis students will pursue coursework in voice, general music, basic and choral conducting, pedagogy, style and diction, and piano. Music education majors will also participate in a choral ensemble. \n\nProgram Advising\nDue the nuances unique to the discipline and study of music, students must work in close consultation on a semesterly basis with the department advisor to ensure adequate and timely degree progress. Music programs involve careful sequencing of core courses and applied music study to progressively build musical competencies and techniques. Introductory courses support not only the key concepts needed for success in the next course in the sequence but also the adjacent core course sequences as well. For example, the music history sequence is highly dependent on the concepts addressed in the accompanying courses in music theory, ear-training, sight-singing, and keyboarding.\n",

    "info": "The bachelor of music in music therapy is a professional, four-year degree program of intensive study in the field of music therapy. This program prepares students for a profession in music therapy, using music to influence behavioral changes in people, from pre-school through geriatrics, in a variety of educational and health-related environments.  Completion of the BMus in music therapy ensures eligibility to take the board certification exam. Successful completion of the exam legitmates students for practice as music therapist-board certified (MT-BC credential). Professional curriculum is approved by the American Music Therapy Association.\n\nProgram Advising\nDue the nuances unique to the discipline and study of music, students must work in close consultation on a semesterly basis with the department advisor to ensure adequate and timely degree progress. Music programs involve careful sequencing of core courses and applied music study to progressively build musical competencies and techniques. Introductory courses support not only the key concepts needed for success in the next course in the sequence but also the adjacent core course sequences as well. For example, the music history sequence is highly dependent on the concepts addressed in the accompanying courses in music theory, ear-training, sight-singing, and keyboarding.",

    "info": "The Graduate Program in Oral Biology emphasizes basic science research. It gives students research skills and a broad understanding of the development, structure, function, and pathology of the orofacial region. Students are encouraged to focus in one of five areas of emphasis: biomaterials and biomechanics; epithelial biology and carcinogenesis; microbiology and immunology; sensory neuroscience; and bone biology, craniofacial development, and tissue engineering. An exceptional student can create his/her own area of emphasis or specialize in topics not listed here; students should discuss their interests with the director of graduate studies before applying. Curricula are designed to allow considerable flexibility in planning individual programs to accommodate specific areas of interest; courses from other disciplines may be included as part of the major with prior approval.",

    "info": "If you have ever pondered, \"Why am I here?\" or \"What is the meaning of life?\" then you have already thought about philosophy. Philosophy poses questions about human endeavors and examines our basic assumptions about everything we think we know. It takes on challenging issues that sometimes defy resolution and trains the brain to think in a rigorous and analytic way about all the possible answers and what's at stake. Philosophy is not just a subject matter but a way of thinking. \n\nIn your philosophy courses, you will learn about the way that people throughout history have engaged in this kind of thinking with questions such as \"Can I really trust my senses to tell me about reality?\", \"Is anything really morally right or wrong or is it all just relative?\", \"Do scientific theories tell us the truth about the world or are they tools that are useful for certain purposes?\" and \"Are some societies more just than others?\". You will discover that thinking about these questions with an open mind is deeply satisfying. Philosophical thinking also contributes to a worthwhile life; in the words of Socrates \"the unexamined life is not worth living\". \n\nOf course, life isn't all about having fun thinking. Philosophy is also much more practical than you might think! Because philosophy is so far-reaching, the method it uses for study enhances the study of other fields such as art, math, science, language, and law with tremendous success. It is a great complement to other majors as a second major or a minor. You can find details about good combinations on our website. Also, studying philosophy is a fantastic way to hone your critical thinking and analytic writing skills. You'll learn two types of critical thinking: First, a method for rigorous analysis of arguments. Second, a habit of asking penetrating questions about the hidden assumptions of any position, ideology, or practice. You will develop your capacities to conceive of alternative assumptions, evaluate which ones are best and determine where they lead. You'll learn to write papers that clearly demonstrate these skills. \n\nAnd finally, you can reassure your parents about your choice of philosophy with the fact that the skills of critical thinking and analytic writing are highly desirable and sought by graduate programs and employers. Evidence of this includes: \n PHIL majors rank first among all majors in law school acceptance rate: 82.4%. \n PHIL majors rank first among all majors in verbal and analytic sections of the GRE (and first among humanities majors in the quantitative section) \n PHIL majors score higher on the Graduate Management Admissions Test (the test that most MBA programs require) than students in any business major (management, finance, accounting, marketing, etc.)\n PHIL majors' salaries increase more over 10 years than most other majors, including marketing and accounting (The Wall Street Journal). \n \"The present value of the extra earnings that graduates in humanities majors can expect over their lifetime is $444,700 for English majors, $537,800 for history majors, and $658,900 for philosophy majors\" (Forbes).\n\nFor more information, visit: http://www.philosophy.umn.edu/",

Physical therapy is a healthcare discipline involved with the study and rehabilitation of movement impairments, such as muscular weakness, impaired coordination, joint stiffness, and pain, which can lead to functional problems affecting self care, employment, ambulation, etc. Graduates are prepared to promote proper health care and quality of living by maximizing human movement following disease or injury or by preventing its loss. The program requires three years of year-round, full-time graduate study (9 semesters including summers). Academic coursework, clinical education, and research activity are completed during the first seven semesters. The final two semesters are devoted to clinical rotations.",

The program is based upon principles from chemistry, physics, mathematics, and biological sciences.\n\nThis major is particularly appropriate for students who intend to enter medical school or graduate study in any of a variety of biological, health, or biomedical sciences. The required courses form a strong core in biomedical science. Many of the required courses are identical to those required for admission to medical school. Students may tailor the overall degree program to specific needs and may choose additional science courses in preparation for medical school, other health sciences professional schools, or graduate school. Students may also take advantage of the freedom to pursue a more diverse undergraduate experience in CLA. Others may benefit from an opportunity to pursue a double major. \n\nFor the latest information, visit the human physiology major website: https://med.umn.edu/physiology/education-training/undergraduate-program",

Students have the flexibility to focus their studies on plants, microorganisms, or the interactions between the two, such as symbiotic interactions or pathogenic interactions. \n\nAll PMB majors are guaranteed experience in a research laboratory, as long as they show satisfactory progress toward their degree and make arrangements by the middle of their junior year. Current faculty research interests include genomics, gene expression, chromosome structure, plant growth substances, signal transduction, plant responses to stress, metabolic activities during development, molecular evolution and systematics, fungal and plant interactions, bacterial physiology, microbial biotechnological applications, nitrogen fixation by bacteria in symbiosis with plants, microorganisms for biodegradation and bioremediation, molecular methods to detect and assess environmental bacteria, and microbial metagenomics.",

    "info": "Political science examines who gets what, when, and how from government. Political scientists study voters, politicians, interest groups, political parties, social movements, institutions, states, and public policies at all levels, from local communities to the global community. The discipline covers four thematic areas: American Politics, Comparative Politics, International Relations, and Political Theory. Political scientists employ multiple tools to learn about politics, including historical methods, case studies, and statistical, archival, and critical analyses. Political science majors develop an array of skills acquired through coursework, research opportunities with individual faculty, and internships that open multiple career opportunities in public, private, and non-profit sectors.\n\nStudents of American Politics seek to understand the way that collective governance happens in the United States. The American Politics subfield is divided into two areas: Political Behavior is the study of public opinion and electoral behavior of voting age adults, and Political Institutions is the study of the formal and informal structures of governance in the United States. Students will learn how research projects are designed and, in some courses, how to collect, examine, and present data. \n\nIn Comparative Politics, we seek to identify factors that explain political outcomes across time and space, with an eye to patterns that transcend historical and geographic particularities. Although Comparative Politics is sometimes thought to refer to the study of politics outside the United States, comparativists reject the idea that American politics are not amenable to comparative analysis. Comparative Politics courses will make you a more informed and discerning citizen in our interconnected world.\n \nIn International Relations, we study how the countries of the world do and don't get along. We address fundamental questions of war and peace, conflict and cooperation, trade, migration, and finance. Taking courses in International Relations helps students better understand how the world works. Students will be expected to write policy memos, conduct independent research, take part in simulations and debates, and devise policy solutions to complicated challenges.\n\nPolitical Theory analyzes the meaning and significance of fundamental political concepts. Starting from foundational concerns as the nature of politics, humans, power and justice, theorists explore how these basic starting assumptions organize the norms, practices, and institutions of political and social order. Students who study Political Theory become more adept at critical thinking, careful reading and clear writing, and recognizing and constructing arguments. These skills are basic for the critical, lifelong role that all of us play as members of political community.\n\nTaking classes across the subfields enables students to become more informed citizens and to pursue a wide variety of careers. Political science majors learn skills including oral and written communication, analytical and critical thinking, problem solving, teamwork, and digital competencies.",

    "info": "For millennia, our survival as human beings has depended on our ability to understand and predict others' behaviors. Today, personal and professional success continues to depend on understanding and predicting human experiences and behavior. Psychology is the scientific study of these experiences and behaviors. Given humans' imposing complexity, psychologists employ a range of perspectives, including evolutionary, biological, social, organizational, institutional, and sociocultural. In turn, these perspectives influence psychologists' levels of explanation, from genetics to brain physiology, personality, individual differences, social interactions and group memberships, the institutions that we inhabit, and the cultures in which we spend our lives. Like all liberal arts disciplines, psychology addresses human experience, but what makes psychology unique as a scientific discipline are the concepts that psychologists use to make sense of people and the methods that they use to learn more about them.\n\nOur baccalaureate programs provide students with a strong general background in all areas of psychology and with\nthe ability to think and reason critically in a wide variety of settings. All psychology students complete three critical courses essential to achieve those goals: PSY 1001 (Introduction to Psychology) provides a broad overview of what psychologists know about human behavior; PSY 3001W (Introduction to Research Methods) focuses on the skills necessary to generate new knowledge; and PSY 3801 (Introduction to Psychological Measurement and Data Analysis) addresses the skills necessary to test hypotheses using statistical methods. Students will complete additional courses focused on their individual interests, and even if they never plan to become psychological scientists, students will develop the skills needed throughout their lives to be sophisticated evaluators of psychological information and to navigate the complexities of human behavior.\n\nThe B.S. degree emphasizes outside coursework closely related to biological and quantitative psychology, including fields such as neuroscience, cognitive and computer science, biology, chemistry, and mathematics. The B.S. prepares students for graduate work in psychology and related fields, and we encourage students interested in the biological, genetic, or evolutionary underpinnings of human behavior to complete outside courses in the life sciences, including biology, chemistry, and evolution. We encourage students interested in quantitative approaches and the cognitive underpinnings of human behavior to complete outside courses in mathematics, statistics, and computer science. A B.S. degree in psychology provides a valuable background for a variety of careers and graduate and professional academic programs, including psychology, medicine, neuroscience, and computer science. A professional career as a psychologist requires training beyond the baccalaureate degree.",

    "info": "For millennia, our survival as human beings has depended on our ability to understand and predict others' behaviors. Today, personal and professional success continues to depend on understanding and predicting human experiences and behavior. Psychology is the scientific study of these experiences and behaviors. Given humans' imposing complexity, psychologists employ a range of perspectives, including evolutionary, biological, social, organizational, institutional, and sociocultural. In turn, these perspectives influence psychologists' levels of explanation, from genetics to brain physiology, personality, individual differences, social interactions and group memberships, the institutions that we inhabit, and the cultures in which we spend our lives. Like all liberal arts disciplines, psychology addresses human experience, but what makes psychology unique as a scientific discipline are the concepts that psychologists use to make sense of people and the methods that they use to learn more about them.\n\nOur baccalaureate programs provide students with a strong general background in all areas of psychology and with the ability to think and reason critically in a wide variety of settings. All psychology students complete three critical courses essential to achieve those goals: PSY 1001 (Introduction to Psychology) provides a broad overview of what psychologists know about human behavior; PSY 3001W (Introduction to Research Methods) focuses on the skills necessary to generate new knowledge; and PSY 3801 (Introduction to Psychological Measurement and Data Analysis) addresses the skills necessary to test hypotheses using statistical methods. Students will complete additional courses focused on their individual interests, and even if they never plan to become psychological scientists, students will develop the skills needed throughout their lives to be sophisticated evaluators of psychological information and to navigate the complexities of human behavior.\n\nThe B.A. degree emphasizes outside coursework in the social sciences, arts, and humanities, including sociology, economics, political science, anthropology, history, philosophy, and literature, given the perspectives and levels of explanation that inform these disciplines. Like psychology, these disciplines focus on the thoughts, feelings, and motivations that make us human, including those that arise from our personalities, relationships, and the larger social forces that shape our experiences. For example, art historians may look to visual portrayals of women over time to understand their lives; sociologists may focus on religion, crime, and race and ethnicity, all phenomena of interest to psychologists; political scientists may focus on citizens' political attitudes and activities; and business-related specialties like personnel selection, marketing, and leadership often rest on psychological principles. A B.A. degree in psychology provides valuable preparation for a variety of careers and graduate and professional academic programs, including psychology, law, management, human resources, and education. A professional career as a psychologist requires training beyond the baccalaureate degree.",

    "info": "There is a growing number of threats to good health at the population level. Public health is the field of study that identifies and monitors these threats, while at the same time, developing and evaluating interventions that reduce their negative impact on community health. Multiple forms of knowledge  coming from analytical, creative, biological, psychological and socio-cultural bases  are needed to effectively work in public health. This bachelor of arts degree focuses on increasing student knowledge of multiple fields that create effective public health strategies to prevent disease, promote health in communities, and eliminate inequalities.   \n\nThe University of Minnesota School of Public Health Bachelor of Arts (BA) in Public Health is a robust undergraduate public health degree to develop graduates who can apply a public health approach to address a broad range of societal challenges. A public health approach is grounded in social justice, and emphasizes addressing challenges at the systems level with a focus on prevention and population health. Graduates will have an academic and experiential background that prepares them to understand, critically evaluate, and impact current and emerging challenges to the health of our global society.\n\nSpecifically, graduates from this program will be able to describe the foundational principles of public health, be able to understand basic methods for gathering and analyzing public health data (through surveillance and research), demonstrate understanding of how public health and social justice share common goals, and be able to communicate in both community and professional settings. This junior-admitting program prepares graduates for entry-level positions in the public health workforce with employment at local health departments, not-for-profit agencies, healthcare systems or standalone research entities. Students interested in pursuing clinical degrees in other health-related fields would also benefit from this program. In addition, students interested in pursuing a terminal degree (a Master's of Public Health or doctoral degree) in public health should consider this degree program as an introduction to the knowledge paradigms used in the field; graduate-level training would build upon this program by providing greater skill development, depth of understanding, and advanced methodologies.\n",

    "info": "Students in religious studies are trained in the critical study of religious thought, practice, institutions, and communities throughout the world and across time periods. The subject of religion is by its very nature interdisciplinary, attracting interest from many perspectives, including textual and literary studies, history, sociology, anthropology, the arts, and philosophy. \n\nStudents in the religious studies program select one of two tracks. The \"religion, culture, and society\" track is designed for students who seek to study religious traditions broadly or comparatively. The \"texts and traditions\" track is for students who seek to study a single tradition deeply, reading its foundational texts in their original language. Both tracks examine religion as a social and cultural force affecting fundamental issues of our world. All majors take courses in at least two religious traditions and develop an interdisciplinary concentration area consisting of four courses, selected from a variety of departments and focused on a theme, tradition, time period, location, practice, or set of questions. The area of concentration must be approved by the major advisor. \n\nFor more information, visit the Religious Studies website at https://cla.umn.edu/religious-studies.",

    "info": "Russian is the native language of some 150 million citizens of the Russian Federal Republic. It is one of the five official languages of the UN, and ranks with English, Chinese, Hindi, Urdu, and Spanish as a major world language. Russian remains the unofficial lingua franca of the former Soviet republics, an indispensable communications tool across all of the Caucasus and Central Asia. Russian is a major language for scientific publication, and it is an increasingly important language for business and trade as Russian institutions, both public and private, integrate with their European and American counterparts. \n\nBesides a thorough grounding in the Russian language, students in the Russian major become conversant with the enormous wealth of Russian cultural heritage in literature, visual art, theater, and music. In particular, Russia has produced one of the world's most vibrant and exciting literary traditions, including the works of poets like Pushkin, Lermontov, Blok, and Akhmatova, and writers like Gogol, Turgenev, Dostoevsky, Tolstoy, and Chekhov. Despite the upheavals caused by the fall of communism, Russian literary culture remains vibrant today, and only a fraction of this fascinating contemporary work is available in translation. \n\nFurther information on the value of a Russian major can be found at http://modules.russnet.org/why/.",

Students are expected to acquire skill in research design and statistics and to develop a comprehensive knowledge of social work and social welfare history, theory, and policy.\n\nThe PhD program does not focus on the development of advanced skills for clinical practice. However, students gain knowledge of practice theory and research related to social work practice. Many graduates assume positions as university faculty. Consequently, the program offers opportunities for students to acquire skills in teaching and curriculum development.",

    "info": "Sociology examines stability and change in social life by addressing the underlying patterns of social relations in formal organizations, in legal institutions, and in the family, economy, and political arena.\n\nCoursework focuses on the criminal justice system and criminal behavior, mental health, families and close relationships, education, urban and rural communities, politics and policy formation, social movements and social change, diverse racial and ethnic groups, and social psychology. Faculty interests in the comparative study of social relations and institutions in various countries add an international emphasis to these areas of study. All sociology courses emphasize the skills of social inquiry necessary for analyzing patterns of social relationships. The sociology BS program is for students interested in developing a rigorous mathematical concentration in research methodologies. This option builds on course requirements for the sociology BA program by featuring 12-16 additional credits of upper division coursework in one of four clusters: (1) organizations, business, or non-profits, (2) health care and careers, (3) policy analysis, or (4) quantitative emphasis. \n\nStudents who graduate from our Sociology program enjoy a wide range of employment opportunities - business, non-profit, government, and non-governmental organizations. The concepts and skills students learn in our Sociology programs equip them to critically analyze the evolving world and the place within, and help them complete effectively in today and tomorrow's job market.\n\nFor more information, visit the sociology website at www.cla.umn.edu/sociology",

    "info": "The bachelor of arts (BA) program in speech-language-hearing sciences (SLHS) represents an internationally recognized comprehensive science-based degree program that offers students a broad liberal arts education in an interdisciplinary field of study. Major coursework provides a background in human communication including the physical, biological, and socio-behavioral processes that empower or disrupt the production and understanding of speech and language. These complex processes are ones that are often taken for granted, but a disorder of one of these processes caused by disease, a problem at birth, or aging can have a profound effect on a person's life. The field of speech-language-hearing sciences defines normal and disordered communication and provides the research foundation for diagnosis and treatment of communication disorders. \n\nThe SLHS curriculum blends science, language and communication, and aims to provide exceptional academic preparation and opportunities for students who are interested in physical and biological sciences and enjoy learning about linguistic, psychological, and neurophysiological theories and methods for diagnosing and treating voice, speech, language and hearing disorders. This foundational knowledge helps students reach careers such as speech-language pathologist, audiologist, psychologist, therapist, counselor, vocal coach, researcher, instructor, manager, or director in related fields.  \n\nProgram requirements for the SLHS major fulfill a number of the University's Liberal Education (LE) requirements. Major students also have multiple options to meet the LE requirement by taking courses in related fields, such as psychology, education, humanities, and social sciences.\n",

The MS in Scientific and Technical Communication focuses on applying basic theory and research-driven approaches to the creation and adaptation of content to solve complex problems in technical communication workplaces. Students connect with workplace professionals through client projects, virtual and global teamwork, mentorships, and emerging technologies. These experiences enable students to develop unique strengths in digital, usability, and science/health/medical communication. \n\nMS courses are taught by graduate faculty who themselves have active research agendas in these areas. Students also have the opportunity to work with the Technical Communication Advisory Board (TCAB), a group of business leaders who provide pathways to experiential learning opportunities including networking, mentoring, and internships.\n\nThis fully online program equips professionals for transition to the technical communication field and/or for specialized study tailored to career goals. All coursework from the Certificate in Technical Communication program can be applied to the MS.\n",

    "info": "The Department of Writing Studies offers a B.S. in Technical Writing and Communication (TWC).  \n\nTechnical writing and communication  creates a bridge between experts and various audiences who put knowledge into practice. The TWC major offers students who enjoy writing the opportunity to use written, digital, oral, and visual communication theory and practice as it happens in the current workplace. Students will study writing and editing, rhetorical theory, visual rhetoric and document design, usability, and technical communication practices.\n\nTWC majors examine how communication is a complex process that involves both the robust principles of audience, persuasion, clarity, accuracy, and ethical integrity, and a command of the knowledge of scientific and technical topics that one communicates.  \n\nOrganizations, both for profit and non-profit, demand people who can communicate ideas or concepts clearly, ethically, and with authority. At the core of these communication skills is a knowledge of writing and how it creates understandings with particular audiences. TWC graduates work in many areas, including health, business, science, law, and technology. Technical writer, usability specialist, user experience designer, and content strategist are just a few of the titles our graduates hold.\n\n\nWhy major in TWC?\n\n1. TWC majors are in demand and sought after by employers. The US Bureau of Labor Statistics predicts technical communication as a career will grow  faster than average over the next decade. And US News and World Report lists technical writer in the top 100 jobs for 2020!\n2. Our advisory board of alumni and industry professionals offers networking, mentorship, internship, and job opportunities.\n3. Students learn to use rhetoric as a powerful communication tool.\n4. Students become familiar with current writing and web technologies.\n5. TWC pairs well with other majors such as political or health science. \n6. Sub-plans enable students to focus their writing skills in one of four emphasis areas: information technology and design, biological and health sciences, legal discourse and public policy, or environmental science.\n\nFor more information, visit z.umn.edu/writugrad.\n",

    "info": "The University established the urban studies program in 1969. In the 1960s, studying cities and urban life and form was considered avant-garde in all disciplines. Urban studies is an explicitly cross-disciplinary major rooted in College of Liberal Arts but accepting courses from a diversity of undergraduate colleges. The program offers students a mix of academic, hands-on, experiential and skill-based coursework focused on a common theme of urban social/cultural issues, urban political economy and planning, urban infrastructure and environment, or international urban issues. Through required urban studies coursework students are exposed to local practitioners who teach courses based around their areas of expertise such as: homeless youth, public-private partnerships, transit development, or housing in an international perspective. These local practitioners expose students to the diverse careers that can come from a degree on urban studies. Students are encouraged to study abroad.\n\nStudents who major in urban studies come to understand the way cities work and use the vast resources of the Twin Cities to explore their interests. All students complete one required 140 hour internship as part of their exploration of careers they might pursue. Finding an internship is great practice for a job hunt. With the vast local network of alumnus of the program, there are many internship possibilities each term.  \n \nThe program offers one-on-one advising and students come to know one another through shared classes and through the student group: Minnesota Urban Studies Student Association\n \nPost graduation some students go on to graduate school in fields as diverse as social work, law, finance, geography, and medicine. Other students elect to spend their post-graduate year in a service based organization such as Teach for America, Peace Corps, Reading Corps, Americorps etc. The majority go on to get some on-the-job experience.\n \nUrban studies gives students a breadth of knowledge and the knowledge of how to be engaged in urban issues often leading  to long-term careers in public service.",

You will be invited to reflect on your own leadership experiences within a learning community that includes fellow students, community practitioners, and faculty. You will learn about your own leadership, deepen your understanding of the young people you work with, and expand your connection within the larger youth work community both locally and globally. You will be invited to think critically about how communities often understand and respond to young people and work to create innovative interventions for young people in schools, community organizations, and the workplace that challenge these typical understandings and create opportunities for young people to fully flourish. How can we collaborate with young people when responding to the most pressing current issues and needs? What organizational structures and strategies support and sustain young people's authentic and meaningful involvement in inclusive, socially just, and equitable opportunities? How can organizations, schools, and communities transform to provide developmentally rich and meaningful opportunities for young people?\n\nUtilizing the most current understanding of youth development joined to issues of inclusion, equity, and social justice, you will graduate with the necessary knowledge and skills to work collaboratively, think critically, and act intentionally to create sustainable opportunities for young people and their communities.  By the time you graduate, you will know what it takes to effectively partner with young people and to transform youth-serving organizations to better respond to all young people and the communities they live in.\n\nThe YDL M.Ed. emphasizes:\n A variety of theories and models in youth work, including critical youth work, community youth work and positive youth development;\n Experiential, interdisciplinary and collaborative learning models;\n Leadership and community building by encouraging consultation among faculty, professional youth workers, fellow students, and young people;\n Diverse, flexible, dialogic faculty that provide an informed understanding of practices, policies, and ethics of youth development work;\n A cohort model for supportive and challenging learning environments;\n A faculty committed to helping students develop a course of study that meets their professional and personal needs and interests.\n",

    "info": "This cross-campus interdisciplinary program provides comprehensive training in water resources science, with integration across scientific disciplines. A structured interdisciplinary graduate curriculum is offered. The program includes a set of core courses plus electives in the following areas of interest: aquatic biology, environmental chemistry, hydrologic science, limnology, water management technology, water policy, water quality, and watershed science and management. A Limnology and Oceanography track is also offered. Approximately 80 courses offered within 15 other graduate programs are available to students majoring in water resources science. \n\nThe goal of the program is to produce scientists with strong technical skills in disciplines relevant to water resources and a broad understanding of 1) the hydrologic cycle and associated ecosystems, 2) the interconnectedness of the sciences involved in managing aquatic resources, and 3) the interplay between the biophysical sciences and social sciences in developing and implementing public policies related to water. \n\nStudents in the program develop the breadth of scientific knowledge appropriate to understand the complicated aquatic ecosystems and watersheds on which they will work, as well as social dimensions of the topic, including the public policy and legal frameworks in which water resources are protected and managed. \n\nThe program involves faculty from the following departments on the Twin Cities campus: Applied Economics; Bioproducts and Biosystems Engineering; Civil Engineering; Earth Sciences; Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior; Entomology; Environmental and Occupational Health; Fisheries, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology; Forest Resources; Geography; Horticultural Science; Plant Biology; and Soil, Water, and Climate. It also involves faculty from the following departments on the Duluth campus: Biology; Chemical Engineering; Chemistry; Civil Engineering; Geography; Geological Sciences; and Physics; as well as the Large Lakes Observatory and the Natural Resources Research Institute in Duluth.

    "info": "This cross-campus interdisciplinary program provides comprehensive training in water resources science, with integration across scientific disciplines. A structured interdisciplinary graduate curriculum is offered. The program includes a set of core courses plus electives in the following areas of interest: aquatic biology, environmental chemistry, hydrologic science, limnology, water management technology, water policy, water quality, and watershed science and management. A Limnology and Oceanography track is also offered. Approximately 80 courses offered within 15 other graduate programs are available to students majoring in water resources science. \n\nThe goal of the program is to produce scientists with strong technical skills in disciplines relevant to water resources and a broad understanding of 1) the hydrologic cycle and associated ecosystems, 2) the interconnectedness of the sciences involved in managing aquatic resources, and 3) the interplay between the biophysical sciences and social sciences in developing and implementing public policies related to water. \n\nStudents in the program develop the breadth of scientific knowledge appropriate to understand the complicated aquatic ecosystems and watersheds on which they will work, as well as social dimensions of the topic, including the public policy and legal frameworks in which water resources are protected and managed. \n\nThe program involves faculty from the following departments on the Twin Cities campus: Applied Economics; Bioproducts and Biosystems Engineering; Civil Engineering; Earth Sciences; Ecology, Evolution, and Behavior; Entomology; Environmental and Occupational Health; Fisheries, Wildlife, and Conservation Biology; Forest Resources; Geography; Horticultural Science; Plant Biology; and Soil, Water, and Climate. It also involves faculty from the following departments on the Duluth campus: Biology; Chemical Engineering; Chemistry; Civil Engineering; Geography; Geological Sciences; and Physics; as well as the Large Lakes Observatory and the Natural Resources Research Institute in Duluth.

They recognize that to ensure positive environmental, economic, and social outcomes, they must prepare comprehensive, long-term plans and employ informed, proficient individuals to carry them out. To accomplish these tasks, these public and private entities rely upon the expertise of employees and consultants who possess both a broad understanding of sustainability and an in-depth familiarity with the particular sector in which they operate.\n\nThe sustainable systems management major prepares students to enter the workforce with the knowledge and skills necessary to design, assess, implement, and manage systems to advance the goals of sustainability. Key features of this inherently interdisciplinary major include its skills-based and content-based integrated core courses, its emphasis on the development of strong analytical and quantitative skill sets, and its broad requirement of foundation courses in mathematics, science, business, economics, history, and policy. \n\nStudents choose to specialize in one of four tracks: (1) corporate sustainability systems, (2) sustainable products business management, (3) building science and technology, or (4) energy systems.",

Specifically how the decisions made by firms determine the economic value of firms or investment opportunities.\n\nSince all firms must invest capital (cash) to operate and grow, all firms simultaneously compete with each other, and all other investment opportunities, for capital in Capital Markets. Finance professionals estimate and evaluate economic value and risk focusing on estimating future cash flow and using information from Capital Markets.\n\nFinance professionals include economists, operating managers, financial analysts, data scientists, researchers, investors, and financial advisors.\n\nFinance professionals are quantitative and analytical, utilizing mathematical tools and building models to inform decision making.\nFinance professionals are curious, researching and understanding firms and markets.\nFinance professionals are strong communicators, helping colleagues understand the financial implications of their business decisions and investment opportunities.\nFinance professionals are comfortable with ambiguity, recognizing and quantifying the economic impact of risk and uncertainty.",

MIS coursework prepares students to make better decisions by applying information technologies to solve business problems and transform enterprise operations and to innovate and manage business processes in different functional areas through the best use of the technological infrastructure of an organization. The collective impact of the coursework is to enable students to understand the role of technology in creating business opportunities and to acquire the skills necessary for the functional management of the tasks needed to secure those opportunities.",

The student learns how business is done within a culture and the importance of understanding the nuances of working across multiple cultures. Students who desire to work in international business will often begin in their primary major and with experience and language skills, move into roles where they have responsibility for working with partners or offices internationally.

    "info": "Global Studies students use a wide-angle lens to cultivate broad perspectives on the contemporary world. For example, you will learn to think of climate change not only in terms of CO2 levels in the atmosphere, but also in terms of politics, ecologies, social movements, and global inequalities. When you examine migration, you will study not only laws and non-governmental organizations analyses of mobility trends, but the geopolitical upheavals and food systems failures that drive these trends. And students will always keep in view the grassroots and community initiatives that address these problems on the ground, since that is where the impacts of these issues are most powerfully felt and creative solutions worked out. In short, Global Studies is a major for students who are committed both to understanding the world they live in, and to making that world a better place. \n\nGlobal Studies courses traverse geography and time. Some analyze the workings of global institutions and explore the operations of the global health, food, and financial systems. Others use works of art and philosophy from around the world to expose students to cultural forms like indigenous art and prison literature. Still others explore long term historical trajectories, such as the growth of global communications, media, and tourism industries. You will also have the opportunity to study abroad, intern, and engage deeply with on and off campus communities. In capstone projects you will bring together what you've studied to define, explore, and create new visions of the world. You will learn both critical thinking and practice the empathy needed to construct global citizenship for the 21st century.\n\nAll learning experiences offer ample opportunities for developing the communications and organizational skills that support success in future careers in any number of sectors including nonprofits, government, and industry, as well as for graduate study in a number of arenas in law, policy, social sciences, and the humanities.",

    "info": "Studies in cinema and media culture (SCMC) examines cinema and media by emphasizing its location within the intricate social, historical, and cultural matrix of audiovisual forms and practices. Core courses and electives are offered not only in the Department of Cultural Studies and Comparative Literature (CSCL), but also in a number of other contributing departments. Through the program's interdisciplinary framework, students explore the sounds and images of cinema and media as they have changed throughout the 19th and 20th centuries. Print, photography, radio, television, video, and digital media are also considered crucial to understanding our media cultures. Students develop the ability to \"read\" the production and circulation of meaning in cinema and media, especially within the institutions of mass culture; examine the history of cinema and media cultures; engage the cross-cultural and global dynamics of production and reception; and explore the theoretical models that have shaped thinking about the cinema and media.\n\nAlthough the major includes a production component, its principal focus is on cultural contexts, history, and theory.\n\nFor the latest information on the SCMC major, visit the CSCL website\n",

Drawing upon the curricular offerings of most of the University's colleges and departments, students design either a bachelor of arts (BA) or a bachelor of science (BS) degree incorporating a significant amount of coursework from at least two different colleges within the University system.\n\nBachelor of science degrees are those that pertain to the physical or biological sciences, have significant quantitative or investigative tools/methods expectations, or have a pronounced applied/professional component (e.g., public health, education, business, social work). Most students design a degree drawing from two or three departmental areas from the University. Examples include sustainability studies, communication studies, and HECUA; or Carlson School of Management, manufacturing operations management, and applied economics.  \n\nICP is most appropriate for self-directed students whose educational backgrounds and career and intellectual interests require both a clear personal focus and a flexible interdisciplinary approach.  Interested students should attend one of the weekly information sessions, in which academic advisers provide a detailed introduction to the program and help students begin the planning process.

    "info": "The Biology, Society, and Environment program (BSE), housed in the Department of Geography, Environment, and Society, is a multidisciplinary biology program in the College of Liberal Arts (CLA). The BSE major is built on the idea that problems of biology, health, and the environment emerge at the intersection of natural and human systems. To understand these problems and their solutions, and to build skill sets to address them, requires that students have experience in the biological and natural sciences as well as in the social sciences and humanities.\n\nThe BSE degree provides a flexible curriculum that allows students to focus the degree to fit their personal, intellectual and professional goals. The BSE degree can prepare students for a wide variety of careers including laboratory science, environmental testing, health and environmental policy, public health, science education, and science communication, as well as a variety of academic and professional graduate programs.\n\nThe BSE major is an excellent choice for students interested in pursuing work in the health professions. Students can design their BSE major to provide the foundational science coursework necessary for their choice of M.D., D.D.S., Pharm.D., R.N., O.T., P.T. and PA programs. Medical programs are increasingly looking for students who have an education that includes social sciences and the humanities. BSE includes courses that help students understand the relationship of a diverse society to our medical system and provides students with the opportunity to think about health not just as an attribute of the biology of the body, but also as a complicated outcome of how different bodies relate to economic, cultural, and social systems.\n\nCourse work in BSE offers students the opportunity to study scientific practices and social and environmental problems. Just as importantly, students have the opportunity to:\n Develop critical thinking skills and creative approaches to understanding such practices and problems using an array of conceptual and theoretical frameworks,\n Consider the ethical issues inherent to both practices and problems and, of course, solutions,\n Enhance their ability to communicate, particularly through writing,\n Work as a team member to bridge disciplinary and institutional divisions,\n Develop language skills to help them better engage with their own diverse communities or to open up opportunities for international work.\n\nResearch is a regular part of the BSE curriculum, and students are encouraged to work with the BSE adviser to find opportunities to work directly with faculty on their research or to find a faculty member to supervise a research project developed by the student. Independent research can provide students with excellent experience that helps them pursue their career goals.\n\nNavigating the Catalog:\nThere are a huge number of courses that count for the BSE major. It can be tricky to understand what is available. To see what is available semester by semester, students should look at the BSE course guide published each semester by the BSE advising office. Students can find the course guide on our webpage at z.umn.edu/BSEcourse",

    "info": "The BMS MS: Gateways to Medicine and Research is designed for students interested in professional health careers or biomedical research who desire additional training, mentoring, and advising to strengthen their academic and professional credentials for admission to health professional or graduate schools, or for entry in the biomedical workforce. This umbrella program has 2 tracks based on desired outcomes. The Medical Track, 1-year (3 semesters) Plan B MS, provides relevant, specialized content and experiences for students interested in health professions. The Research Track is a 2-year Plan A MS with research thesis that provides targeted training and research experiences on biomedical sciences. The mission of the Gateways MS Program is to recruit and train diverse students that upon graduation will enrich the region with their newly gained expertise. The Gateways MS Program will be a natural fit for regional students who wish to further their education in a small city close to nature and home. We will focus on recruiting students that are: 1) Indigenous, 2) rural low income, or 3) other BIPOC/underrepresented in medicine (URM) and STEM. Training a diverse healthcare and research workforce will alleviate a historic lack of opportunities for underserved populations. In accordance with historical responsibilities, mission-fit students will be eligible for scholarships to offset tuition costs. To support our students, we will build a culturally inclusive environment that promotes awareness and respect for all students. We will recruit students from diverse pre-med, STEM, and behavioral science disciplines. Students with other majors are encouraged to apply with a description of how their experiences will enrich the program. Graduation requirement will be completion of 30 credits in 1 or 2 years. Credits are earned in discussion-based classes, problem-based learning (PBL), bench research (Research Track only) along with relevant professional experiences and community projects. The active learning, innovative curricula are tailored for each track around the science of human physiology and disease. This content will appeal to students interested in: (1) health professions (new applicants and near misses), (2) exploration of academic careers in biomedical research, (3) biotechnology / pharmaceutical industry, (4) teaching health sciences, or (5) broader science applications in business, regulatory affairs, entrepreneurship, writing, or policy. The curriculum will be delivered by experienced faculty who teach the foundational content of the Duluth Regional Medical School (DMED) under a distinctive high contact - high content model. The Medical Track consists of a 3-semester, structured curriculum with clinical and community experiences and dedicated MCAT prep time. The Research Track offers multiple electives and bench skills with experienced mentors in exciting research areas, including neuroscience, genetics and genomics, cancer biology, immunology, physiology, and parasitology.

The 30-credit program, which can be completed in 24 calendar months, is conceptually and structurally distinct from the academic master's degree in mass communication in that it focuses on advanced professional study of communications strategy, media, planning, evaluation, and creative management. The MA in strategic communication curriculum is tailored to provide the best foundation for future communications leaders, recognizing that the communication industry is changing rapidly. With digital communication continuing to transform the industry, and massive organizational and global forces reshaping the U.S. economy, communications leaders face significant challenges and can prepare themselves through in-depth study of strategic process management.",

Students develop verbal and visual skills in architecture, and practice the design process as a dialogue between divergent and convergent making and thinking. They undertake projects that link architecture with explorations in visual media (including film, photography, virtual reality), social, cultural and environmental concerns (preservation, disaster relief, neighborhood needs), focused concerns (daylight, facade, material, or modeling studies), and allied disciplines (set design, landscape architecture, urban studies).\n\nAll major coursework must be taken A-F.",

Students learn the skills and tools necessary to succeed across a broad range of industry, nonprofit and government settings.\n\nAll students are required to take a core set of courses that together ensure a strong foundation in the fundamentals of industrial and systems engineering. Each student also customizes a technical elective course plan to prepare them for the career path that most interests them. Student's chosen electives can result in a minor or emphasis in one of a number of fields, such as financial services, manufacturing and service operations, supply chain management, and healthcare operations.\n\nAll students complete a final capstone project that provides them with real-world experience by collaborating with a sponsoring company or organization. Students work in teams and receive guidance from a faculty advisor and industry mentor for 15 weeks during their senior year. This capstone project provides students with hands-on experience and proof of their abilities as they prepare to launch their career.\n\nThe program is accredited by the Engineering Accreditation Commission of ABET, www.abet.org.",

    "info": "The Master of Accountancy (MAcc) program enables all students to understand technical accounting problems from an analytical approach, enhancing their critical thinking and management skills with graduate-level courses in accounting, data analytics, finance, taxation, information systems, management, and supply chain and operations. In addition, it provides non-accounting majors the opportunity to take the accounting courses required to sit for the CPA examination. \n\nThe MAcc program offers two tracks, a 30-credit track for students with a degree in accounting or finance. The 44-credit track is for students with a bachelor's degree in an academic discipline other than accounting or finance. The additional required core courses include the necessary accounting courses needed to sit for the CPA exam. \n\nThe curriculum has been designed and developed by Carlson School of Management faculty with extensive input and ongoing consultation with executives from the professional community. This ensures relevant, practical, and challenging courses that enhance the students' professional development. The program offers students the opportunity to delve more deeply into challenging financial reporting issues faced by organizations. Students develop complex computational analysis skills and analytical processes to better understand modern financial reporting issues.\n\nThe 30-credit track can be completed in one year if going full-time. The 44-credit track can be completed in 1.5 years if going full-time. Students may also choose to go part-time. Many of the courses are offered in the evenings (Monday-Thursday, 5:45  9:05 p.m.) or online.",

Students choose one of three areas of emphasis: Hispanic Literatures & Cultures, Lusophone Literatures & Cultures, or Hispanic Linguistics\n\nThe Hispanic Literatures and Cultures track provides solid intellectual and professional preparation in Iberian and Latin American literatures and cultures. Works and intellectual movements are studied in their historical, social, and cultural contexts, combining the approaches of literary and cultural criticism with those of intellectual history, sociology, gender and sexuality studies, among others.\n\nThe Linguistics track is centered on the relation between language and its context of use, encompassing social, pragmatic, and discourse factors. It provides students with a strong background in the following areas of Hispanic linguistics: phonetics, phonology, syntax, pragmatics and discourse, historical linguistics, language variation, and second language acquisition. \n\nThe Lusophone Literatures & Cultures track prepares students in Portuguese studies, understood as an interdisciplinary critical formation through which the cultures and literatures of Portugal, Brazil, and Lusophone Africa are approached. Students are trained in the main historical periods, cultural movements, and social issues pertaining to the Portuguese-speaking world, both nationally and transnationally, within relevant comparative frameworks.  \n",

    "info": "The Hispanic and Lusophone Literatures, Cultures, and Linguistics PhD program provides students with a focused and rigorous formation in the literatures, languages, and cultures of Spain, Latin America, and the Portuguese speaking world.  Students choose one of three areas of emphasis: Hispanic Literatures & Cultures,  Lusophone Literatures & Cultures, or Hispanic Linguistics. In addition to establishing a specialization in one or more areas of Hispanic or Lusophone studies, the program allows and encourages students to pursue comparative or interdisciplinary work. Students complement their work in the department with coursework in other disciplines such as: Gender, Women, and Sexuality Studies; Medieval Studies; Linguistics; Curriculum and Instruction; History; Cultural Studies and Comparative Literature; African-American and African Studies; Human Rights Program; Geography; Sociology; and Moving Image Studies. \n\nThe department's faculty is committed to preparing students and giving them the tools to become scholars and teachers of the highest quality. The department has a strong tradition of fostering socio-historical perspectives on literatures, languages, and cultures. The graduate Literature & Cultures faculty is committed to comparative and interdisciplinary research and engages a variety of contemporary theoretical approaches, with strengths in postcolonial theory, social justice and human rights, memory studies, critical race theory, diasporic studies, and gender and sexuality studies. Members of the Hispanic Linguistics faculty are specialists in the fields of sociolinguistics, second language acquisition, syntax, pragmatics, and phonology. \n\nThe department offers students in the program faculty mentoring, a seminar, and workshops on professional development, including publishing, teaching, and interviewing. In addition, graduate student workshops in both literatures and cultures and in linguistics foster student-faculty relations and allow graduate students to ready themselves for conference participation. Travel funds are available through the department to allow students to present their papers at conferences in the United States or abroad. ",

    "info": "The goal of the Ojibwe language major is to best situate both heritage and non-heritage Ojibwe students to be able to positively intervene in the cultural life of the state's Ojibwe communities by contributing to the revitalization of the Ojibwe language. As a land grant institution, the University has a mission to contribute to the state's communities, and the major will help fulfill that mission. The department also prioritizes local American Indian community engagement and advocacy. One of the single best ways to create positive change within our communities is to instill pride and celebrate cultural traditions like language at an early age. \n\nWhat distinguishes this program from any other is our use of both academically rigorous grammatical instruction (supported by linguistic research) coupled with the use of immersion techniques inside the classroom. This method has proven to be a very powerful combination in helping our students reach a high level of proficiency in the Ojibwe language. Students who complete the program to attain this high proficiency will have the foundational skills to contribute to Ojibwe language community building by bringing the Ojibwe language back into the home, to go into the high-demand field of immersion teaching, and to work in language preservation programs. With this major, students will:\n\n1) Be more prepared to fill an ever-growing need for immersion teacher positions;\n2) Graduate with a more sophisticated knowledge of the Ojibwe language in general;\n3) Graduate with the prestige that comes of having earned a bachelor's degree in the Ojibwe language;\n4) Have more time to increase their fluency under instructor supervision;\n5) Increase their knowledge of immersion pedagogy;\n6) Earn a bachelor's degree in the Ojibwe language (rather than a certificate) thereby increasing both their Ojibwe language credentials and earning potential upon graduation.",

As such, physiology is a \"hybrid\" field in which expertise from many other disciplines is ordinarily required and combined.\n\nThe program emphasizes a quantitative approach to understanding the functions of cells, organs, and systems in living animals. PhD students take a core concentration that provides a broad background in the physiology of membranes, cells, transport, and organ systems. Individualized programs are structured to build on the student's strengths and to fill in gaps that would otherwise be an impediment to specific problem solving. Teaching experience is also available to all students.\n\nThe graduate program in the Twin Cities has cardiovascular, hypertension and metabolism emphases, although many other areas of specialization are represented.\n\nStudents can enter the PhD program from the Twin Cities or Duluth campus. Highly qualified individuals with solid quantitative backgrounds are encouraged to apply. In the Twin Cities, prospective students also include people with previous medical training who are already at the University of Minnesota or are considering the University of Minnesota Medical School for residency or fellowship training.\n\nEntering PhD students are expected to take a series of laboratory rotations to familiarize themselves with active areas of research within the degree program. The program includes faculty and corresponding research laboratories from the Department of Integrative Biology and Physiology and also the Departments of Medicine; Surgery; Neuroscience; Neurosurgery; Biochemistry, Molecular Biology, and Biophysics; Pharmacology; Physical Medicine and Rehabilitation; Kinesiology; and Animal Science.",

The department's programs emphasize applications of physics, chemistry, and biology to understanding the Earth.\n\nEarth scientists are employed in a wide range of fields, including exploration for and development of natural resources (hydrocarbons, minerals, groundwater); environmental science; urban planning; education; and oceanography. Potential employers include the oil, gas, and minerals industries; environmental consultants; federal and private research institutions; universities; schools; and government agencies. An advanced degree is usually required for a career in research or teaching.\n\nStudents who earn an Environmental Geosciences B.S. degree may not earn an Earth Sciences B.S. degree.",

Many of our students also have majors in such fields as business, computer science, biology, English, history, linguistics, or political science, or have interdisciplinary concentrations like global, media, and sustainability studies. In the GSD major, students develop advanced language competency, come to understand changing cultural and social contexts in relation to various forms of media (from oral and manuscript traditions to book culture, film, and hypermedia), and deepen their interdisciplinary understanding of other cultures. A major in GSD is ideally suited for students wishing to work in public, private, and non-profit organization fields, especially in areas where multilingual and transcultural knowledge is essential. The department recommends study abroad in the target language for at least six months to strengthen cultural familiarity and language fluency. Students may apply appropriate study abroad coursework to the major or minors. Minors are available in Dutch, German, Finnish, Norwegian, Swedish, and Austrian & Central European Studies.",

The major prepares students for rewarding careers in diverse areas, such as research and development (plant breeding, genetics, or plant molecular biology); food and plant production (sustainable and organic production or floriculture and nursery production); plant use and function (restoration of damaged landscapes); and management of landscapes (agro-ecology and turf grass management). Students gain experience in the use of plants to produce food and other useful products, alter environments, restore damaged landscapes, improve human health and well-being, educate people about science and agriculture, improve community environments, and provide recreational and practical benefits to the public.",

    "info": "Food systems are interconnected sets of biological, technological, economic, and social activities that nourish human populations. The activities include farming, food processing and manufacturing, food distribution and retailing, food consumption, and managing post-consumption food waste. The food systems major offers graduates the knowledge, problem-solving skills, and leadership ability to address complex and often controversial challenges and opportunities in food systems, guided by a desire to create systems that are increasingly sustainable in environmental, economic, and social terms, in diverse contexts and at different scales.\n\nThe core courses in the food systems major begin with an orientation to food systems followed by a core sequence that provides a basic understanding of the structure and interactions within food systems; introduces techniques for life cycle analysis of the outcomes, impacts, and sustainability of food systems; and explores conventional, sustainable, and organic examples of production systems for food plants. The core course sequence culminates in a capstone experience aimed at solving real-world problems in local community food systems, and involvement in future systems design and visioning. \n\nStudents will choose from one of two existing tracks of required courses or in collaboration with an advisor, will develop an individually tailored coursework track.\n\nFlexibility in course sequence and required courses has been incorporated into the major so that students can transfer into the program and still graduate in a timely fashion. This flexibility will also make it attractive to students who wish to pursue a dual major or minor with food systems as one of those majors.",

    "info": "Classical and Near Eastern Religions and Cultures is an interdisciplinary major with two tracks: \"Classical and Near Eastern Religions and Cultures\" & \"Languages and Literature,\" reflected over four sub-plans. The major enables students to gain a broad and in-depth appreciation for the complexities of ancient Mediterranean religion and culture. Through exploration of ancient literature, archaeological sites, artifacts, inscriptions, and manuscripts, students learn about major historical figures (e.g., Egyptian rulers, Alexander the Great, Cicero, Socrates and Plato, Jesus, Moses, Mohammed, Roman Emperors, etc.), fascinating ancient literature (e.g., Homer's Iliad  and Odyssey, the Epic of Gilgemesh, Plato's Apology and Symposium, Euripides's Prometheus Bound and Bacchae, poetry by Catullus and Virgil, the Hebrew Bible and the New Testament, the Quran, etc.), and everyday ancient social realities (e.g., family, gender, status, economy, politics, agriculture, religious practice, sanctuaries, magic, etc.). You will also learn how to analyze ancient Mediterranean religions (Greek and Roman religion, ancient Israelite and Jewish religion, ancient Christianity and Islam). After some initial course requirements in one of several of our larger courses, students in the CNRC sub-plan take courses in three interrelated areas: State, Self, and Social Power; Literature and Intellectual History; and Religious Discourse, Authority, and Practice. Students in the Languages and Literature subplan take specific introductory courses and then can go on to study Greek, Latin, or Modern Hebrew. The field of classical and Near Eastern religions and cultures is at the root of many varied disciplines and careers from law and communications to non-profit work and administration. Any career that requires the skills of careful, critical analysis, deep research and understanding of cultural systems, and insight into the motivations of a plurality of religious perspectives active in the world today will benefit from this major. Our professors offer a collegial and friendly yet academically rigorous environment where you can grow in these skills and bring them to your current situation and future work.",

    "info": "The medical laboratory sciences BS degree program consists of two years of prerequisite courses and a two and a half year professional program sequence. Students are typically admitted to the professional program sequence after completing the prerequisites. Students may also be admitted directly into the final professional year after completion of the prerequisites and the upper division science requirements. Admission is once a year for the upcoming fall semester. The program uses an active learning hybrid program delivery format. Courses are offered through online modules, and other technology-enhanced delivery methods. Students then meet in person once per week for discussions, case studies, and problem solving exercises. The MLS program is fully accredited by the National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences (NAACLS). \n\nThe program prepares students to be professional laboratory practitioners who are not only able to perform medical laboratory testing but analyze and critique the accuracy and validity of testing results for the improvement of patient care or research design. Graduates are eligible to take the American Society for Clinical Pathology Board of Certification examination and be certified as medical laboratory scientists. In addition to the medical laboratory setting, graduates of this program are qualified to work in a variety of other laboratory facilities such as research, environmental, biomedical, public health, or forensic laboratories. With the curriculum emphasis on developing quality understanding of laboratory methods and their diagnostic interpretation, our graduates are also excellent candidates for graduate research degree programs or graduate medical professional schools. Graduates of the MLS Program are also prepared to be leaders in healthcare delivery, medical laboratory professional societies, or as members of a research and development team. \n\nSince it began in 1922 as the first educational program for medical laboratory personnel, the MLS Program at the University of Minnesota has been a leader in the profession. Faculty in the program published the first article on quality control in the clinical laboratory, developed the first medical laboratory technician program, and established the first master's degree in clinical laboratory sciences. The program is proud to provide students with the opportunity to learn from faculty who focus on clinical excellence, critical thinking, analysis, evaluation, scientific inquiry, leadership, and professional and community service. Current faculty perform laboratory-based research as well as scholarship in the field of teaching and learning. Many faculty also hold national and state offices in professional organizations, including the American Society for Clinical Laboratory Science (ASCLS) and the National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences (NAACLS).\n\nAs a part of one of the nation's most extensive interdisciplinary academic health centers, the University of Minnesota's MLS program provides opportunities for interaction with students from other health professions as you prepare for a progressive career in laboratory medicine.",

    "info": "Health coaching is an emerging method of partnering with clients/patients to help them achieve their overall goals. Integrative health coaches practice from a holistic perspective that views the client as intrinsically healthy, whole, wise, and the ultimate expert in their own well-being journey. Health coaches do not diagnose or treat illness but assist those with health conditions to make meaningful changes in their lives to enhance their overall well-being. While an individual may make some changes alone, many changes happen more easily within the structure and support of a partnership, which can be uniquely provided by a health coach. This assistance includes necessary connection to resources, and the assembly of an optimal, interprofessional healthcare team. The ability to perform this role requires that health coaches have a comfortable working knowledge of both conventional and integrative healthcare. \n\nThe Earl E. Bakken Center for Spirituality & Healing is a pioneer in the health coaching field, working to advance education, research, and care model innovation. The Master of Arts in Integrative Health and Wellbeing Coaching was the first master's level health coaching degree to be offered through an accredited university in the United States. Graduates of the program work in a multitude of practice settings, including hospitals, clinics, health educational facilities, community centers, senior living centers, fitness venues, corporations, schools, and private practice.\n\nAll required coursework is offered in a blended format that combines online curriculum with in-person intensives. Students are required to be on campus one extended weekend per semester during year one. The program requires a set of core coaching classes, with additional coursework in health behavioral change theory, mind-body science, trauma-informed mental health, leadership, evidence-based decision-making, principles of management in health services organizations or coaching for chronic conditions, and group health coaching. One credit of elective coursework rounds out the degree, which gives students the opportunity to take other CSPH courses. Students may also use the credit to satisfy requirements for a minor in another department. Students finish the program with a 3-credit internship. \n\nThe Bakken Center for Spirituality & Healing Integrative Health Coaching programs are accredited by the National Board for Health and Wellness Coaching (NBHWC) (https://nbhwc.org). The Bakken Center has been a national leader in defining the scope of practice, developing educational competencies and standards of practice, and helping to lead the creation of a national certification process and exam in Health and Wellness coaching. \n\nAlthough the instruction is based on research in the field, this Plan B degree is not intended to provide intensive research training and is understood to be a terminal degree.

Compared to the BS degree, this program reduces the number of required mathematics courses and increases the number of applied statistics courses, or courses in a supporting quantitative area. Students who complete this program using statistics electives will have applied statistics training equivalent to most master's programs in statistics.",

The first is to provide students with sound graduate training in the biological sciences relevant to the global conservation of plants, animals, and ecosystems. The second objective promotes the study of social, political, and economic sciences that relate to recognition and solution of conservation problems. Students may select one of three tracks, conservation science track or fisheries and aquatic biology track or wildlife ecology and management track. Students may also pursue a joint degree in law and conservation sciences through the joint law degree program. The overall goal of the program is to prepare students to develop solutions or approaches to address problems that are scientifically and environmentally sound and likely to be acted upon or implemented within their social and political context.",

Although such a commitment to public interpretation, education, and preservation is part of all these disciplines, it is of tremendous benefit to heritage professionals to understand the connections and common issues in all of these perspectives because the heritage field is increasingly characterized by such interdisciplinary integration.\n\nThe goal of this graduate program is to provide heritage and public history professionals this broader view, increasing their resource base and network of expertise. The program takes advantage of the deep scholarly expertise in these fields at the University of Minnesota, as well as the Minnesota Historical Society's extensive resources and expertise, to offer unparalleled training in the theory and methods of heritage and public history studies at the graduate level. The program will combine rigorous scholarly training with hands-on professional development, preparing graduates for positions in major public history and heritage institutions in Minnesota and elsewhere. The program will also train future generations of scholars and practitioners in the field to develop new, innovative, and entrepreneurial forms of historical interpretation in service of the public good.  \n\nStudents are expected to acquire both general and specialized sets of perspectives and skills. Some required courses are designed to instill breadth and cohort connections; others are designed to build expertise in specific arenas of the heritage field, represented by the program tracks. Students will engage in experiential learning through embedded (credited) internships, and the design and execution of a community-engaged project.",

The goal of the program is to train all students for careers in research and college teaching in developmental psychology, and to prepare students in the developmental psychopathology and clinical science program options for careers in applied areas of child psychology as well.\n\nStudents are admitted to either the developmental science track or the developmental psychopathology and clinical science track. Developmental science track students may choose to specialize in an area such as cognitive neuroscience, language, learning, personality, memory, perception, psychobiology, or social development.\n\nStudents interested in clinical research may specialize in developmental psychopathology and clinical science through participation in the developmental psychopathology and clinical science (DPCS) training program. DPCS training is a cooperative effort between the Institute of Child Development and the Department of Psychology to instruct leaders in research and teaching. DPCS training draws on the unique strengths of each program. Students in this track complete a required clinical internship, which adds an additional year to program completion.",

    "info": "Pharmacology is the study of drugs, the mechanisms through which they affect living systems, and the ways in which drugs are acted upon by living systems. A drug is defined as any foreign entity that exerts an effect on a biological system, whereas a therapeutic is a drug that is intentionally administered in order to elicit a favorable outcome. Investigators in the program in Molecular Pharmacology and Therapeutics (MPaT) focus on developing greater insight into the molecular mechanisms that determine biological responses to therapeutic agents, and how underlying biological variation impacts these responses. In addition, MPaT program faculty strive to develop a greater understanding of basic mechanisms of molecular biology, and in particular how these processes are altered in disease states. The ultimate objective of these latter studies is to gain insight that can lead to the development of future novel therapeutic agents. The MPaT graduate program is designed to prepare students academically and professionally in the field of pharmacological research to make them competent as scientists and competitive as job candidates. Students who have earned their MS from this program occupy a diverse array of high-level positions in the fields of scientific research, drug development and discovery, and medical outreach. The MPaT graduate program consists of 74 faculty trainers, each of whom is equipped to offer students training in highly diverse research areas. MS students can expect individualized mentorship and training from their advisors. For their part, students are expected to perform at a high level in the lab and classroom, produce publishable scientific data, and to adhere to the standards established by their advisor, the MPaT graduate program, the Department of Pharmacology, and the University.\n",

    "info": "The goal of the Dakota language major is to best situate both heritage and non-heritage Dakota students to be able to positively intervene in the cultural life of the state's Dakota communities by contributing to the revitalization of the Dakota language. As a land grant institution, the University has a mission to contribute to the state's communities, and the major will help fulfill that mission. The department also prioritizes local American Indian community engagement and advocacy. One of the single best ways to create positive change within our communities is to instill pride and celebrate cultural traditions like language at an early age. What distinguishes this program from any other is our communication-centered approach based in storytelling and Dakota lifeways and knowledge in addition to using both academically rigorous grammatical instruction and immersion techniques inside the classroom. This method has proven to be a very powerful combination in helping our students reach a high level of proficiency in the Dakota language. Students who complete the program to attain this high proficiency will have the foundational skills to contribute to Dakota language community building by bringing the Dakota language back into the home, to go into the high-demand field of immersion teaching, and to work in language preservation programs. With this major, students will: \n\n1) Be more prepared to fill an ever-growing need for immersion teacher positions; 2) Graduate with a more sophisticated knowledge of the Dakota language in general; 3) Graduate with the prestige that comes of having earned a bachelor's degree in the Dakota language; 4) Have more time to increase their fluency under instructor supervision; 5) Increase their knowledge of immersion pedagogy; 6) Earn a bachelor's degree in the Dakota language (rather than a certificate) thereby increasing both their Dakota language credentials and earning potential upon graduation.",

CNRC is dedicated to rigorous philological and literary training and to the conviction that the ancient Mediterranean world is best studied as a diverse but richly integrated cultural whole. The various tracks allow students to concentrate in the area and period that most appeal to them, but students are strongly encouraged to take courses across the entire range of the department's offerings and to develop a broad, multidisciplinary approach to research and teaching. Related special facilities include the Center for Medieval Studies, the Center for Jewish Studies, the Consortium for the Study of the Pre-Modern World, and the Program in Religions Studies.",

In the Youth Studies program you will:\n Learn a myriad of theories about young people including: cultural, political, sociological, phenomenological, biopsychological, and historical perspectives of youth\n Identify and interrogate the ideas and ask increasingly complicated questions about young people and what is known about them\n Reflect on your own experiences of being a young person and your own youthhood\n Engage and learn about the everyday lives of youth\n Leave prepared to imagine and engage in a range of youthwork practices and professional spaces\n Graduate with a background in designing innovative youth interventions and evaluation and research methods to explore what these create for young people and the communities they live in\n\nYouth Studies students engage community through regular site visits, program observations, community-engaged learning, international exchanges, and internships. Students are supported by culturally competent academic advising and one-on-one student-elder partnerships with faculty, staff, or community leaders.
