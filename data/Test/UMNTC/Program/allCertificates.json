    "info": "This graduate-level certificate program gives students an opportunity to complete a coordinated series of courses in the area of dual language and immersion education. The program does not lead to a state teaching certificate or licensure (note that a university certificate program or certificate is distinct from a state certificate or certification). \n\nIn Minnesota and other states in the US, dual language/immersion teachers at the elementary level are required to hold a teaching license in elementary education, and at the secondary level a license in the subject matter they teach (e.g., science, social studies, math). The University of Minnesota offers an initial teacher licensure program in elementary education with a focus on dual language and immersion education. \n\nThe dual language and immersion education certificate program is designed for preK-12 teachers and other professionals to be able to work effectively in the following school-based program models: \n- \"One-way\" foreign language immersion programs designed for native English-speaking students \n- \"Two-way\" bilingual immersion programs designed for native English-speaking students and native speakers of the program's partner language, such as Spanish \n- Developmental bilingual programs designed for minority language learners, such as native Spanish speakers \n- Indigenous language immersion programs designed for Native American children in indigenous communities with the goal of revitalizing an endangered language and culture \n\nIn dual language and immersion programs, the second/foreign/minority language that students are acquiring is a vehicle to teach school subjects. In order to be considered a dual language or immersion program, the immersion language must be used for at least 50 percent of subject-matter instruction during the elementary school years. In a middle/secondary continuation program, at least two, year-long content courses must be taught in the immersion language. \n\nThese programs aim for \"additive bilingualism and biliteracy,\" or the acquisition of another language at no expense to the first, native language. \n\nThis unique University certificate program incorporates a coherent set of courses designed specifically for dual language and immersion teachers, and other professionals. Offered by the college's Department of Curriculum and Instruction (C&I), the program was designed jointly by the college's Second Language Education faculty, and representatives of dual language and immersion programs in the Twin Cities metropolitan area.",

    "info": "The certificate in teaching writing and critical literacy prepares preK-college educators to strengthen their skills and knowledge of current practice and research in the teaching of critical reading and writing (note that a university certificate program or certificate is distinct from a state certificate or certification).\n\nWriting and reading complement one another, and their interconnectedness is critical to literacy instruction. This certificate will offer advanced knowledge of the teaching of literacy through a focused, rigorous program while developing practicing educators' skills as teachers and writers in a supportive learning community.\n\nChanging literacy needs of students from all socioeconomic and educational backgrounds demand highly qualified teachers of reading and writing at the K-12 and postsecondary levels. Educators must prepare K-12 students to meet testing requirements at the state and national levels. In addition, teachers must meet the increasing literacy needs that accompany Minnesota's changing demographics of growing immigrant and English language learner (ELL) populations. Educators also must prepare students to communicate effectively by using new technologies.\n\nThe certificate program seeks to accomplish the following goals:\n Develop effective strategies for teaching the writing process to English-language learners and diverse populations, as well as reading and writing across the curriculum.\n Engage educators in current research about composition, reading, and learning theory.\n Create learning communities where educators reflect on their own teaching, reading, and writing.\n Give educators opportunities to learn from other practicing educators.\n\nThis program begins with a three-week, 3-credit Minnesota Writing Project (MWP) Invitational Institute and then extends to allow educators to choose from a wider range of courses from multiple University departments throughout the academic year.

Orthoptists work with ophthalmologists, eye physicians and surgeons, as part of the medical team. They are employed in a variety of settings, including university and teaching hospitals, children's hospitals, and solo or multi-specialty group medical practices. An orthoptist sees a variety of patients of all ages, although due to the nature of their visual disorders, the majority of the patients are young children; some individuals with multiple health concerns are also evaluated as they commonly have ocular/binocular problems. \n\nStudents who successfully complete the Orthoptics post-baccalaureate certificate are eligible to sit for the written and practical examinations, administered by the American Orthoptic Council, required for national certification.",

    "info": "The medical laboratory sciences certificate program consists of 2-3 semesters of professional program courses and 1 semester of clinical practicum. Students from academic affiliate schools or those who already have a baccalaureate degree can apply for admission directly into the final professional year after completion of the prerequisites and the upper division science requirements. Admission is once a year for the upcoming fall semester. The program has a full-time hybrid delivery (more than 50% online delivery) through online modules, interactive television, and other technology-enhanced delivery methods. \n\nThe MLS program is fully accredited by the National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences (NAACLS). The program prepares students to be professional laboratory practitioners who are not only able to perform medical laboratory testing but analyze and critique the accuracy and validity of testing results for the improvement of patient care or research design. Graduates are eligible to take the American Society for Clinical Pathology Board of Certification examination and be certified as medical laboratory scientists. In addition to the medical laboratory setting, graduates of this program are qualified to work in a variety of other laboratory facilities such as research, environmental, biomedical, public health, or forensic laboratories. \n\nWith the curriculum emphasis on developing quality understanding of laboratory methods and their diagnostic interpretation, our graduates are also excellent candidates for graduate research degree programs or graduate medical professional schools. Graduates of the MLS Program are also prepared to be leaders in healthcare delivery, medical laboratory professional societies, or as members of a research and development team. Since it began in 1922 as the first educational program for medical laboratory personnel, the MLS Program at the University of Minnesota has been a leader in the profession. Faculty in the program published the first article on quality control in the clinical laboratory, developed the first medical laboratory technician program, and established the first master's degree in clinical laboratory sciences. The program is proud to provide students with the opportunity to learn from faculty who focus on clinical excellence, critical thinking, analysis, evaluation, scientific inquiry, leadership, and professional and community service. Current faculty perform laboratory-based research as well as scholarship in the field of teaching and learning. Many faculty also hold national and state offices in professional organizations, including the American Society for Clinical Laboratory Science (ASCLS) and the National Accrediting Agency for Clinical Laboratory Sciences (NAACLS). As a part of one of the nation's most extensive interdisciplinary academic health centers, the University of Minnesota's MLS program provides opportunities for interaction with students from other health professions as you prepare for a progressive career in laboratory medicine.

It encourages the integration of academics and co-curricular experiences through the common language of core career competencies and connects the academic experience to their professional life. \n\nThe certificate is open to all CLA undergraduate students.",

The curriculum focuses on technical information, critical thinking skills, legal and ethical concepts, effective communication and interpersonal skills, management principles, and the ability to work as a member or leader of a team. Courses explore the complex and unique challenges facing safety professionals, such as constrained resources, increased demand for services, risk assessment, the media, and public perception. Environmental health and safety is a complex subject because many factors influence the effect of the environment on human health. The curriculum recognizes the interrelation of environmental health and diverse geography, according to states or countries as well as urban versus rural environments. Diverse population demographics such as age, gender, ethnicity, culture, socioeconomics, and underlying susceptibilities of people also influence the impact the environment has on human health. All these aspects need to be considered when assessing risks and managing environmental health in the workplace, and are broadly reflected in the curriculum.",
