    "info": "Substantively, this course surveys the rich and varied history of influential feminist ideas. These ideas propel us to think critically about sex, gender, sexuality, and the categories that intersect with them; these ideas provide us with language to express ourselves more critically and creatively; these ideas enable us to rethink relationships of power and forge coalition-al values and connections across difference. This course also holds the field of feminism accountable for its influence, in hopes of contributing to more liberating feminist theories. Methodologically, this course develops students’ skills in tracking arguments, understanding commonly used theoretical terms, learning how to apply theory to real life situations, and honing students’ theoretical writing.",
