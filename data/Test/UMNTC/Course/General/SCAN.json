In this course, History of Nordic Cinema, we will survey discrete moments in Nordic film history (viewing films from Denmark, Finland, Iceland, Norway and Sweden) and contextualize them within broader developments in global cinema. Particularly important in this regard will be Nordic Cinema's love-hate relationship with Hollywood and its complicated status as European Cinema. We will begin in the beginning, with examples of Scandinavia's often-underestimated role as an international, artistic, and popular culture powerhouse in the silent era up through WWI. We'll go on to explore Nordic film productions intended mainly for domestic audiences and juxtapose these with the emergence of a compelling modernist, art-house cinema tradition revolving around the international figure of the auteur director, including Ingmar Bergman and later, Aki Kaurism√§ki. We'll consider examples of 60s and 70s political, avant-garde cinema (reverberations of the French Nouvelle Vague); talk about the unique development of state-funded structures for film production in these small countries; and end with a survey of recent Nordic films and movements such as Dogme 95 that illustrates ways in which small national cinemas continue to grapple with new iterations of globalization. In this course, students will be exposed to visual cultures from all five Nordic countries and consider the implications of reading film at regional, national and global levels. In short, Nordic Cinema provides a vital and vibrant case study with which to consider a broad range of issues involving the aesthetics and politics of cinema in the world. ",

Despite this well-earned reputation for political and aesthetic progressivism, there has also been a significant undercurrent of anti-rationalism and supernatural horror in Nordic culture. In Gothic fiction, the unwelcome appearance of primitive, irrational, and malevolent forces often takes the form of supernatural or monstrous figures‚Äîghosts, vampires, witches, and trolls. As conventions established abroad mingled with a home-grown tradition of social realism, the Scandinavian Gothic became a vehicle for representing marginalized voices and revealing the shortcomings of Nordic societies. We will examine Gothic works of literature, film, television, popular music, and visual art. Through this examination, we will build an analytical vocabulary to formally analyze works of Gothic art in all of these media, and will practice that through in-class discussions as well as formal and informal writing.",

    "info": "Scandinavia is popularly thought of as a bastion of social democracy, gender equality, and sleek modern design. Despite this well-earned reputation for political and aesthetic progressivism, there has also been a significant undercurrent of anti-rationalism and supernatural horror in Nordic culture. In Gothic fiction, the unwelcome appearance of primitive, irrational, and malevolent forces often takes the form of supernatural or monstrous figures?ghosts, vampires, witches, and trolls. As conventions established abroad mingled with a home-grown tradition of social realism, the Scandinavian Gothic became a vehicle for representing marginalized voices and revealing the shortcomings of Nordic societies. We will examine Gothic works of literature, film, television, popular music, and visual art. Through this examination, we will build an analytical vocabulary to formally analyze works of Gothic art in all of these media, and will practice that through in-class discussions as well as formal and informal writing.",
