    "info": "Science is predominantly an empirical field. At its core, the scientific method is based on the formulation and testing of hypotheses based on observations and measurements; but how do we “see” in science? Cells are too small to see with the naked eye, proteins and molecules are too small to be observed even with the most powerful microscopes. So how do scientists know a process is happening and what that process is? Many powerful techniques have been developed over the years to help scientists observe the systems of interest, each type of observation providing specific data. The data, however, are often subject to interpretation. We will discuss different imaging and characterization techniques widely used in Chemistry, Biology, Biochemistry, and Material Science. Classes will include field trips to several imaging and characterization facilities hosted by various Departments and Colleges on the Twin Cities campus and guest lectures by experts in specific techniques.",

    "info": "Sustainable development is critical to the future of the planet, its people, and our communities. Evidence of its importance are the efforts by the United Nations and a large number of organizations, including the University of Minnesota, to advance sustainable development goals. Sustainable development considers factors such as climate change, food and agriculture, energy, health, the environment and its pollution, economic growth, and technology development (e.g. green chemistry). In this First-Year seminar we will learn about how these factors are interconnected, how they affect us, how they shape our future and how we with our career can play a role in sustainability.Our weekly activities will include:1. Talking with experts on these topics2. Exploring how these topics are interconnected and affect each other3. Playing with computer simulations to understand how these factors affect climate change4. Learning what is being done world-wide (United Nations and its Sustainable Development Goals), in the State, and at the University of Minnesota5. Discovering what we can personally and through our education to contribute to sustainable development",
