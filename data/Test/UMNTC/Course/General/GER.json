We will focus on how memory of the Holocaust is still present in Germany. During spring break in Berlin, the vibrant cultural, political, and film capital of Germany, we will learn about the complex layers of historical and cultural memory in Berlin through exploring a number of important film and visual art projects. Among other sites we will visit are the Olympic Stadium, the Jewish Museum, the Monument to the Murdered Jews of Europe, remnants of the Berlin Wall, and public art projects that reflect on histories of trauma. There are few cities so scarred by a traumatic history and so often reborn—and so well documented by films from the entire span of the 20th century and into the new one. This course will look at some of those films and the city in which they were made. At home and abroad, we will discuss how German visual culture has been intertwined with German history and politics, and how that role has evolved over time.",

This course addresses this question by exploring the complexity of Jewish culture in modernity, with a focus on 20th and 21st century German and American literature. We will first tackle the open-ended and endlessly productive question of what is meant by Jewish culture. What is a Jewish writer and is there such a thing as Jewish writing? What makes a text \"Jewish\"? How do Jewish authors challenge the assumptions of majority culture in their work? What role do multilingualism and translation play in the formation of Jewish cultures at the margins? We will trace the lines of affinity between the U.S. and Europe to explore the entangled histories of Germans and Jews, and between German Jews and Turkish Germans, as we look at works that challenge and expand the definition of Jewishness in the 20th century. Additional topics to be considered include how the legacies of American slavery and European colonialism shape our understandings of the Nazi genocide of the Jews, and whether Jewish writing should be understood under the rubric of \"whiteness.\" Moving beyond the approach to German Jewish literary studies anchored in Weimar Germany, we will explore the circulation of Jewish memory between Europe and the U.S. in the aftermath of the Holocaust. We will read works by, among others, Franz Kafka, Paul Celan, Gershon Scholem, Hannah Arendt, Benjamin Stein, Walter Benjamin, Barbara Honigmann, Hélène Cixous, Raymond Federman, W.G. Sebald, Allen Ginsberg, Adeena Karasick, Alfred Kazin, Saul Bellow, Philip Roth, Bernard Malamud, Avram Sutzkever, Zafer Şenocak.prereq: No knowledge of German required; some work in German must be done in order to count this course toward a German minor or a German, Scandinavian, Dutch major.",

As the event itself recedes into the past, our knowledge about the Holocaust has become increasingly shaped by literary and filmic representations of it. This course has several objectives: first, to deepen students' historical knowledge of the events and experiences of the Holocaust, and at the same time to introduce critical models for examining the relationship between personal experience, historical events, and forms of representation. This class will introduce students to the debates about the politics of memory and the artistic representation of the Holocaust, with special focus on public debates about the complex ways in which Holocaust memory surfaces in contemporary Germany and Austria, and by the accrual of layers of text and discourse about the Holocaust. We will explore the controversies and debates about public Holocaust memorialization in Germany, Austria, and the U.S. We will also explore the complex interplay between documentary and fictional accounts of the Holocaust, with attention paid to literary and film texts that challenge and \"remediate\" the limits of Holocaust representation. Additional topics will include Holocaust testimony; Holocaust memoirs, and 2nd and 3rd generation Holocaust literature, the Historians' Debate of the 1980s.No knowledge of German required.",
