    "info": "Outer space, sometimes called the ?Final Frontier,? has always been difficult to reach due to the tremendous expense of rocket launches and the limited number of launch opportunities. In this hands-on course, we will hone ?amateur-spacecraft?-building skills including light-weight-but-rugged structural assembly, microcontroller programming, soldering, wiring, and CAD. Then we will design and build miniature spacecraft and use relatively-inexpensive helium-filled weather balloons to carry them into the stratosphere (AKA ?near-space?), which has many of the same physical properties (and view!) as outer space. The overarching theme for Fall 2022 payloads will be ?Preparing for eclipse ballooning missions(to be conducted during solar eclipses in October 2023 and April 2024).?The balloon launch and recovery will be a required day-long class activity on a weekend date in late October or early November. This activity is weather dependent, so the flight date will need to be flexible. A ?primary? date and several back-up dates will be announced at the start of the semester. After the balloon flight, the remainder of the semester will involve data analysis as well as discussions and activities relating to full-fledged (i.e. outer space) spaceflight, including scientific accomplishments and engineering challenges of past, current, and future space missions.",

In this hands-on seminar, we will explore the fundamentals of flight through the design, flight test, and analysis of small, UAV (uninhabited aerial vehicle) aircraft. Initially, we will cover the history and fundamentals of flight through lectures and discussion, answering questions such as, \"how do aircraft fly?\" and \"why do aircraft look so similar?\" Then, working in small teams, students will design, build, and flight test an electric remote-control aircraft. Students will analyze the flight tests to see if the aircraft performed as expected, write reports, and present on the results. Additional elements of the seminar may include lectures, discussions, and activities associated with aircraft, including the engineering challenges of past, current, and future aircraft.",

In theabsence of software, a closed loop system can be rigorously designed via control theory. In the absence of dynamicalmodels, complex specifications of software or hardware can be verified via formal methods. Over the last two decades,there has been a great interest in using formal methods to verify complex control systems. An essential thing in formalmethods is specifying the desired complex requirement in a rigorous and compositional way. To this end, a suitabletemporal logic is used to describe such specifications (which are more than classical stability or controllability). Inthis course, we will learn various temporal logics with different expressiveness, representations of these temporallogics, abstractions of dynamical systems, and algorithms that will synthesize controllers ensuring the satisfaction ofthe desired temporal logic specification.",
