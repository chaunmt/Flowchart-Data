How have those in power sought to legitimize their rule through the arts? Can the arts maintain their independence? What is the responsibility of the listener in a highly political environment? This seminar will examine the role of art and art censorship by focusing on one of history?s most brutal regimes, which was also among the greatest patrons of music. What compromises and benefits followed when a musician, conductor, or composer collaborated? Did exploiting music actually help the Nazis to build support? How should citizens of democratic societies commemorate and/or judge the choices that artists made in harsher times?",

This seminar deals with exactly this problem: What is music doing to us? Why do we listen to it? And how? What is its meaning in our lives, why does it matter, which realities does it touch, how can it be communicated? In what way is it distributed between intellect and emotions? And why do we go to concerts, since electronic media and the internet provide such easy access? The answers will be approached via intensive listening to all kinds of music from different cultures and epochs as well as through critical, very open discussions with the students. The instructor is highly sensitive to non-authoritarian music cultures, so he may provide a thoroughly dynamic and flexible access to music.",

    "info": "This course will take a broad sweep across the repertoire of rock-era popular song, encompassing a host of styles and genres in its exploration of the craft of songwriting. We will work together to develop a basic vocabulary for describing and critiquing the music we encounter, seeking to arrive collaboratively at a language through which to make sense of creative decisions on the large scale and small. That will mean looking in detail at musical parameters that include chord progressions, melodic trajectory, rhythmic nuance, and instrumentation, but neither the ability to read music nor any previous knowledge of music theory is required.Among the earliest material under consideration will be songs like Carole King’s 1960 “Will You Love Me Tomorrow,\" which displays an ingenious, deeply compelling encounter with a basic 32-bar “ballad” form that had been in circulation for decades. Among the latest will be songs like Kendrick Lamar’s 2015 “King Kunta,” whose successive verses stage an incremental increase of rhythmic activity so dramatic and propulsive as to leave the very idea of a succession of “verses”—that undergirding principle of pop-song repetition—in question. This pair provides some sense of the breadth of material under discussion.",

    "info": "This course examines the variety of ways African and African Americans express social history through music. It will consider the union of African elements and European elements that combined to present a new syncretized African-American product. To do this it is imperative that we explore the diversity of musical \"voices\" found within the African American culture. This diversity can be seen in the struggles to retain African cultural effects and the desire to be eclectic, creative, and contemporary. Such an approach to the study of the place of Black music in American music corresponds with the criteria of Diversity and Social Justice in the United States Liberal Education. The \"multi-layered operation of power, prestige, and privilege\" can be understood through an examination of the music of African Americans, which represents both a Free African voice and an enslaved African voice; the western-trained Black performer/composer and the self-taught performer/composer. It also represents the habits of well-to-do African Americans and the poor African Americans. Students will examine the complexities of the history of African Americans and how this is played out in the development of musical styles and genres. From this, students will then begin to understand how this unique diversity within a community affects those outside of those communities. Such an approach to the study of the place of Black music in American music corresponds with the criteria of Diversity and Social Justice in the United States Liberal Education. We will follow elements found in West African culture and music such as \"call and response\" and the \"2nd Line\" as they travel to the \"New World\" and expressed through Spirituals, Symphonies, Gospel Music, Jazz, Rock and Roll, Step Bands and more. Through lectures, readings, discussion, audiovisual examples, and homework assignments student can expect to gain a deeper understanding of the ways music both reflects and influences the social history of all Americans.",

Although the course focuses directly on the musical details, techniques, and forms pertaining to popular songs, larger questions of meaning and interpretation, production, sound and instrumentation, history of musical style and genre and historical periodization, important individual performers/songwriters and artistic formations, marketing and sociology, and globalization will not be ignored—but they will be most often pursued in the context of analyzing specific songs and recordings. Like any viable form of music, popular music is also a living practice, and hence our engagement with popular music will also require us to be in contact with practitioners of popular music here in the Twin Cities. Finally, the course will require students to engage with popular music in a number of ways—transcription, analysis, aural skills, ethnography (of a modest sort), composition, performance, and expository writing. The class begins with basic parameters as explored in rock music (which, for the purposes of this class, overlaps with classic R&B/soul), then moves backwards to various origination points for rock in American popular music, and then pursues various different topics for the remainder of the course.prereq: [MUS 3501, MUS 3511] with a grade of C- or better",

    "info": "This course provides a basic introduction to analyzing popular songs, primarily those within the Anglo-American tradition. Although the course focuses directly on the musical details, techniques, and forms pertaining to popular songs, larger questions of meaning and interpretation, production, sound and instrumentation, history of musical style and genre and historical periodization, important individual performers/songwriters and artistic formations, marketing and sociology, and globalization will not be ignored, but they will be most often pursued in the context of analyzing specific songs and recordings. Like any viable form of music, popular music is also a living practice, and hence our engagement with popular music will also require us to be in contact with practitioners of popular music here in the Twin Cities. Finally, the course will require students to engage with popular music in a number of ways: transcription, analysis, aural skills, ethnography (of a modest sort), composition, performance, and expository writing. The class is in part organized around basic parameters as explored in rock/pop music (form, timbre, harmony, rhythm, etc.) and otherwise around selected focused topics of study (individual artists or genres, specific research questions, etc.). prereq: undergraduate- MUS 1502 and MUS 1512 with grade of at least C- or highergraduate- MUS 3508 and MUS 3518 with grade of at least C- or higher, or passing score on tonal entrance exams.",

For musicians, the interplay of unconscious habits and the body mechanics of daily use of the self strongly affect tone production and technique.  The Alexander Technique provides tools to enhance fundamental coordination leading to greater performance ease and a reduction of chronic aches and pains.

Most assignments and reading will involve close analysis of particular songs and artists. Students will also hone aural skills through transcription work and performance/music making opportunities.

Voice teachers disagree wildly about the best method of voice production; linguists are fascinated by the acoustic complexity of speech; and ethnomusicologists have no comprehensive theory of vocal action that accounts for the hundreds of distinct vocal traditions in the world, or for the great ethical and political power wielded by elevated speech and song. Indeed, political \"voice\" is often exercised silently (voting, letter writing, silent protest), and submission to political authority is often affirmed vocally (through pledges, songs, and oaths.) This course proceeds optimistically, in the hope that we can find our way through this vocal thicket through historical and ethnographic study, close listening, acoustical analysis, and experimental performance.
