For centuries an historic, scholarly, and artistic center, Toledo was long famed for its religious tolerance, with Christian, Jewish, and Muslim populations coexisting within its walls. Class will begin in Minnesota with writing experiments, readings, and discussions: why do we travel and what do we gain from a journey into the unfamiliar? How have travelers past and present reacted to cultures and environments not their own? In preparation for spring break in Spain, students will respond to a variety of writing prompts and assignments: the travel memory, the food review, the creative tour guide, the work of ekphrasis, the annotated map, etc. Then, on arrival in Toledo, students will wander through tangled streets, cathedrals, fortresses, synagogues, and museums, keeping a detailed travel journal and taking notes for a final essay as they go. We'll benefit from guided tours of Spanish monuments and museums and take day trips to Madrid and to Segovia. Writing and revising will be emphasized throughout the semester as modes of discovery.

These varied writing assignments will allow students to develop the core writing skills of brainstorming, drafting, and revising as well as communicating ideas in different modes for different audiences. Useful for writers, science students, and those engaged with environment issues, and curious adventurers, the class begins after spring break and extends into May with a two-week immersion experience in New Zealand.An island nation of fiords and volcanoes that has followed a unique evolutionary path, New Zealand is the ideal place to read and write about the natural world. Populated by flightless birds and outsize insects, it has no native land mammals except bats. The country, also called Aotearoa, \"The Land of the Long White Cloud,\" is at the forefront of many scientific debates and challenges, including evolution on islands, the impacts and control of native species, climate change, and reintroduction biology. We will explore Wellington, the capital city, as well as Dunedin, the \"Wildlife Capital of New Zealand,\" a city rich in Maori and Scottish heritage, Victorian architecture, and literary tradition. We will meet with scientists and conservationists working on issues that face both New Zealand and the entire planet. In addition, we will take trips to Matui/Somes Island, a predator-free scientific reserve, the Museum of New Zealand (Te Papa Tongarewa), and the Otago Peninsula, home of colonies of little blue penguins and royal albatross.",

In Toledo, they will wander through tangled streets, shops, cathedrals, fortresses, synagogues and museums, taking notes for poems, stories, and essays as they go.

For centuries an historic, scholarly and artistic center, Toledo was long famed for its religious tolerance, with Christian, Jewish, and Muslim populations coexisting within its walls. In both locations, we will have guided tours of Spanish monuments and museums, and students will reflect on the experience of travel via many different types and styles of writing assignments: the daily post-card, the food review, the creative travel guide, the work of ekphrasis, the annotated map, the daily journal, etc.  Why do we travel and what do we gain from visiting cultures and environments that may be unfamiliar?

To graduate with a BA in English, students with an interest in creative writing may choose to produce a substantial manuscript of poetry, literary fiction, or literary nonfiction rather than an extended, scholarly essay. In this advanced creative writing workshop, students receive instruction on writing this manuscript from tenured and tenure-track faculty in English. Class sessions typically include in-class writing exercises, which are then expanded into more finished works of poetry or prose reviewed by the faculty and discussed in workshops by the students themselves. Writing exercises and assignments lead, at the end of the semester, to a finished, thoroughly revised manuscript of at least 2,500 words. Faculty teach students to produce a significant body of poetry, fiction, or creative nonfiction though discussions of method, craft, and development; instruction in specific writing techniques; workshopping and revising drafts; solving problems; and creating a coherent and elegant final product. While the subjects about which students write vary depending on student interest and faculty expertise, at least 50 percent of the course grade is determined by students’ writing performance. The seminar also functions as a capstone experience that fulfills many of the Student Learning Outcomes for the English major and the capstone course for those who are pursuing a Minor in Creative Writing.

    "info": "Journalism isn't fiction. Yet the relationship between what is true and what is artfully constructed toward a \"larger truth\" -- beyond the facts -- has a complex and intriguing history. This writing-intensive course explores that relationship through close readings of some the best writers of long-form nonfiction, starting with the birth of the novel from journalistic roots in the 18th century and ending with postmodern forms that challenge the notion of what we can ever know. Discover the literary devices used by Stephen Crane's reported street scenes or Nellie Bly's first-hand investigations into conditions for the mentally ill in the 19th century, and, later, Truman Capote's nonfiction novel about a Kansas farm family's murder. Readings include works by pivotal 20th-century writers such as John Hersey, Joseph Mitchell, Lillian Ross, Michael Herr, Norman Mailer, Gay Talese, Joan Didion, Tom Wolfe, and Hunter S. Thompson, and will trace how their pioneering methods influenced contemporary journalism as well as the documentary films of Errol Morris and contemporary nonfiction writers expanding into new forms.",
