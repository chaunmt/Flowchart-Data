Depending on that day’s price, there might be a 100 cryptos with a notional market cap above one billion and about 15 above 10 billion. You will learn that cryptocurrencies are extremely volatile. Is it all hype or this the shape of our future? Will this be another Tulip craze? How will they effect regular commerce? Are they just digital gold? How will governments step in to regulate them? Will Governments issue their own Digicoins?\nIn this course, we will not be able to answer all the above questions. However, you will gain a basic understanding of the new technology that is based on cryptography. We will discuss what it provides and where it is still lacking. We will revisit the role of money and what makes a currency successful. We will then examine the properties of cryptocurrencies and ask what it would take for them to be a store of value and/or a medium of exchange. To do this we will start with some fundamental concepts from cryptography that would allow you to understand the technology beyond some stretched analogies. We will discuss the economics of these currencies and the regulatory issues facing governments. We will then delve into the use cases: Primary markets (ICOs & venture capital), secondary markets and exchanges, smart contracts, and potentially settlement activities in clearing houses.",

You willdevelop a set of skills and concepts that will permit you to understand and to analyze the foundations of the economy at large. We want to understand the main drivers of economic growth over time and across countries. Key skills and conceptual take-aways from this course:1. Explain how an economy, firms, labor, and finance fit together.2. Able to use the Solow and Romer growth models: i) to understand long term growth, ii) topredict shock effects, iii) to measure TFP iv) to examine GDP differences across countries3. Understand labor market using supply and demand, and using the bathtub model4. Able to analytically derive the classical gains from free trade. Understand key benefits anddrawbacks to globalization.The lectures are structured as Foundations, Growth, Labor, Globalization. We start by setting up a foundation that stresses the fact that things have to fit together coherently. We need to be careful about how we measure things. The role of firms and financial markets are frequentlymisunderstood so we devote special effort to why these exist and what role they play.Next we turn to the overall evolution of the economy – sometimes called mega-trends. People open underestimate the amount of economic variation from one decade to the next and hence may not adequately prepare. A key purpose of this course is to help you understand keydrivers of economic growth, and the wealth difference across time and between countries. This will provide context for you to think about some potentially forthcoming major changes.  The role of labor deserves special attention since it connects directly to human beings. Thetreatment of, and returns to labor are critical to human welfare. We will consider the labor market in general, unemployment, and inequality both within and across countries.Finally we will examine the role of globalization and international trade. We will formally develop the classical gains from free trade. We will also discuss the reasons for controversies surrounding trade and globalization.prereq: 3001 or 3001H, CSOM major or Math major/Act Sci, or Management minor.",
