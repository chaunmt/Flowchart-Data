Physical principles of clothing and human anatomy are explored. A theoretical understanding of human anatomy and movement is applied through advanced patterning techniques for a variety of body types, work environments, and activities. Class projects are often conducted with an outside partner. Project work focuses on developing skills in collecting, synthesizing (in written and visual form) and using evidence to inform the design of a solution to a user-centered problem. Written documentation, developmental prototypes, and final design solutions are produced and evaluated.",
