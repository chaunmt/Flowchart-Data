Strategies to determine when an animal model isappropriate for a given application will be discussed. During this course each participant will develop andpresent their own idea of a translational animal model (naturally occurring or experimental) in their areaof research interest.The class will be alternate each week between the participating institutions. It will be held in person bythe hosting institution and participants from other institutions and will participate via Zoom or anotheronline platform.
