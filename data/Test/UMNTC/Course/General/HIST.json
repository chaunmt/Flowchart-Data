    "info": "Organized around a series of themes, this course will begin with a broad overview of imperialism in Asia before diving into economics of empire, technologies of imperialism, race and gender, nationalism and the end of empire, and neocolonialism. Throughout, the class will center the history of present-day China, India, Southeast Asia, and Japan, emphasizing whenever possible the perspectives of those impacted by empire rather than those perpetuating it. As such, assigned readings focus on primary sources supplemented by relevant secondary research, with optional readings providing significant breadth and depth for interested students seeking to delve further into their own interests or find new avenues of scholarly inquiry. All told, the histories included here represent some of the most significant events in recent centuries, but ones that often go overlooked in an academic context, covered only as a footnote in the histories of the West. Instead, this course will center the history of Asia and the voices of those impacted by imperialism, offering new perspectives on some of the most significant moments that shaped-and continue to shape-our contemporary world. Designed as an introductory course for those unfamiliar with the history of Asia, this class approaches a broad geographic and temporal range through case studies, diving deeply into crucial historical moments rather than providing an exhaustive overview of more than two centuries of Western imperialism. Simultaneously, this class will introduce students to the process of historical analysis itself using a substantial focus on primary sources, instructional time spent in libraries and archives, and a well-supported, intensive research essay process as a way to encourage them to think critically about the historical project while also honing their own historiographical skills. Overall, students will leave this course with a strong foundation in the history of Asia and the history of Western imperialism along with real practice “doing” history, preparing them for their future within the Department of History, at the University of Minnesota, and beyond.

    "info": "This course traces the development of Judaism and Jewish civilizations from their beginnings to the present. With over three millennia as its subject, the course must of necessity be a general survey. Together we will explore the mythic structures, significant documents, historical experiences, narratives, practices, beliefs, and worldviews of the Jewish people. The course begins by examining the roots of Judaism in the Hebrew Bible and the history of ancient Israel but quickly focuses on the creative forces that developed within Judaism as a national narrative confronted the forces of history, especially in the forms of the Persian, Greek, and Roman empires. Rabbinic Judaism becomes the most dominant creative force and will receive our greatest attention, both in its formative years and as it encounters the rise of Christianity and Islam. After studying the Jewish experience in the medieval world, we will turn to Judaism’s encounter with the enlightenment and modernity. The historical survey concludes by attending to the transformations within Judaism and Jewish life of the last 150 years, including a confrontation with the experience of the Holocaust. Woven throughout this historical survey will be repeated engagements with core questions: “Who is a Jew?” “What do Jews believe?” “What do Jews do?” “What do we mean by ‘religion’?”   “How do Jews read texts within their tradition?” And perhaps most importantly, “How many answers are there to a Jewish question?” Students in this course can expect to come away with some knowledge of the Bible in Judaism, rabbinic literature and law, Jewish mysticism and philosophy, Jewish nationalism and Zionism, Jewish culture, ritual, and worship in the synagogue, the home, and the community, and Jewish celebrations of life cycle events and the festivals.",

It was also marked by the rise of a series of New Right movements from the rise of the Barry Goldwater to the election of Richard Nixon and the transformation of both the Democratic and Republican parties. Major immigration reform, transformations in the nation's educational and health care systems, along side new patterns of consumption and new forms of media were also products of the Sixties. From the Cold War to the Vietnam War, from anti-imperialism and anti-colonialism to third world revolutions, Americans transformed the world and the US was transformed by the world in the sixties.Fifty years removed from the sixties, the idea of the sixties remains alive in the American imagination. It remains alive and in tension with the new movements, like Black Lives Matters, and in political thought, as, for example, in Donald Trump's repeated invocation of the \"silent majority.\" Students will explore a wealth of primary sources and be introduced to the dynamic historiography of the 1960s. As a class, we will also consider how the sixties continues to serve as a powerful trope that organizes political and social thought in the 21st century.",

Exploring changing meanings of manhood and the complicated constructions of masculinity from the colonial era to the present, this course argues that understanding \"men,\" \"manhood,\" and \"masculinity\" is central to understanding United States history. At this nation's founding, family manhood was central to maintaining social order in the colonies and citizenship rights were the sole possession of those who could claim to be free, white, and male. Up through the 20th century, manhood has frequently been associated with specific sets of political, economic, social, and familial rights and responsibilities. At the same time, the denial of rights to large portions of the nation can be traced to their purported lack of manhood. Students in this class will debate and explore how questions of manhood and masculinity shaped and continue to shape the nation. ",

Civic Readiness Initiative. We believe that this cross-fertilization is critical because the fault-lines of inequality have precisely cohered to these structural formations and categories of analysis, i.e. race and racism.

In 1900 Britain was the most powerful and important global force, claiming a quarter of the world’s land and population. By 2016, Britain was again reduced to a small island nation, more defined by its relationship to the US and Europe than its own power and importance.

    "info": "In 1776, when Thomas Jefferson announced the goal of the new United States of America to be securing for all people the rights of \"Life, Liberty, and the Pursuit of Happiness,\" he was implicitly echoing the ideals of the new and modernizing culture that historians have come to call \"the Enlightenment.\" The eighteenth-century Enlightenment gave birth to a new sense of the human being and his and her place in the new naturalized understanding of society and government that was also articulated at this time. Jefferson's stress upon happiness as a human right also pointed to the new importance placed upon material pleasure and the permission to go after it (read: liberty even as it leads to libertinism and licentiousness). A time of profound philosophizing and scientific breakthroughs, the Enlightenment was just as often found in its wit, humor, and snarky take downs of traditional authorities and the pompous pretensions of the establishment. Jefferson illustrates well the serious side of Enlightenment, but just as emblematic was the freethinking Ben Franklin and the John Oliver style news-a-comedy circulated by the self-styled French philosophers Denis Diderot and Voltaire. This course will survey the highlights of Enlightenment conceived as that historical moment when our own free and pleasure-driven modernity was born, along with the science and philosophy that grounds it. Readings will focus on original Enlightenment texts, including philosophy and science, but also novels, bawdy dialogues, satirical poems and essays, paintings and engravings, plays, the autobiography of an emancipated slave, and an opera. Class sessions will be devoted to discussing the texts in light of their contemporary and historical resonances, and student work will focus on writing reflective and interpretive essays and commentaries asking and answering the questions \"what is Enlightenment?\" and \"how do we make ours really good!\" ",

While many think of the state in terms of “Minnesota nice”, fewer are used to considering the history of rural Minnesota as radical - questioning and challenging the fundamental structures of society.  There are a number of topics this course will cover--from the rise and fall of the Farm-Labor movement to the emigration of Hmong people to the state.  As bookends, the course will begin with the many changes in the indigenous societies of Minnesota in the 18th and 19th century, and it will end with the events of 2020.  This seminar will utilize collections at the Minnesota Historical Society, the Mill City Museum, the American Swedish Institute, the Hmong Museum as well as collections held by the University of Minnesota library system. The UMN RATE system could be easily incorporated into the course assignments as the freshmen learn how to “do college” as so many of them describe it. The course will focus on rural Minnesota specifically to ask how the region participated in and then abandoned various social movements from Radical Republicanism to the Farm-Labor movement to present day Trumpism. In this process, the class will ask what a more just Minnesota could have and should look like.  We will also investigate the role of respectful disagreement in public discourse and whether direct or violent action can be justified in a democracy.    ",

    "info": "Is democracy under threat? The upsurge of populist authoritarianism and racial nationalism around the globe in conjunction with recent assaults on traditional political institutions in the United States have raised concerns about the fate and future of democracy. Political scientists largely agree that the United States has become more democratic over the past two centuries, but results from the Authoritarian Warning Survey, a democratic-monitoring project, highlight the erosion of democratic principles and institutions in the past few years. Concerns about the meaning, nature, promise, stability or instability of democracy are, however, not new. In order to better understand contemporary threats to democracy this course explores how the meanings and understandings of democracy changed over the last few centuries by examining the complicated relationship between democracy, populism and racial nationalism. Is democracy a product of populism or imperiled by populism? What is the contemporary and historical relationship between democracy and racial nationalism? This seminar delves deeply into these questions by exploring a series of moments when the meanings and promise of democracy were contested. It begins with fundamental questions about the racial and gendered origins of American democracy. What is the relationship between the democratic state, the slave state and the settler colonial state? How did racial nationalism constitute and imperil American democracy from its origins? Populists, that is members of mass movements that claim to speak for \"the people,\" have struggled to both extend and redefine the limits of democracy. In these efforts, \"citizens\" have frequently been pitted against non-citizens making questions of immigration, naturalization, and detention central to contestations over democracy and its perceived threats. Moreover, in the United States, the relationship between detention and democracy can not be fully explored without paying significant attention to the rise of mass incarceration over the past half century. To what extent is the democratic state today threatened or maintained through the carceral state? Student will engage with these issues through interdisciplinary lectures, course readings and discussions, and conversations with scholars, activists and organizations fostering democratic values and racial justice.This course comes out of the Democracy under Threat Interdisciplinary Collaborative Workshop. Students will be invited to all Democracy under Threat events during the 2019-2020 academic year, including a Spring 2020 Conference, \"Democracy under Threat in Times of Populism and Racial Nationalism\" that will be held at the University of Minnesota in partnership with Howard University, Morehouse College, and Spelman College.

This seminar focuses on how historical interpretations are negotiated through commemorations, monuments, museums, reenactment, film, and other access points to history.  Foregrounding issues of race, class, ethnicity, and gender, we will explore debates surrounding the production of historical interpretation memory.  Public contests over historical meaning in relation to colonialism, events such as the Civil War, World War II, and 9/11 and even over the naming of places such as battlefields highlight the contested nature of history as well as the powerful hold of historical interpretation.",

In a world increasingly characterized by separations and divisions (made visible in the proliferation of physical walls and the hardening of borders) between rich and poor, between the privileged and the disenfranchised, between those whose lives matter and those who are understood to be entirely expendable, this course asks students to think about historical constructions of difference (such as race and gender), and about the past and History in relationship to the challenges of the present and towards a future yet to come.This course will introduce history majors to the methods and practices of historical knowledge production and to the philosophy of history.

Students will learn about critical and philosophical assessments of history as a discipline and its epistemologies (or ways of knowing). What does it mean to study and teach history in particular social and political contexts?  What are the possibilities and limits of the study of history?  What is the historian’s task? How do historians know what they know? What methods and skills do historians use? This course introduces history majors (and non-majors) to the methods and practices of historical knowledge production and to the philosophy/theory of history. Put slightly differently, the course will introduce students to the work/craft of history as thought and methodology. It will also encourage students to think about history (as discipline, method) critically, to address questions such as: What is history for and what does the student of history/the historian do in research (as the detective and the archivist), in writing (as the storyteller and the analyst), and in (critical) thought (as the teacher and the philosopher)?

    "info": "Ancient Egypt exerts fascination upon modern societies, as it did upon its ancient contemporaries. The decipherment of the hieroglyphic script, in the early 19th century CE, opened the way to recovering its history all the way back to the invention of the writing system more than 5,000 years ago. Ancient Egypt has meanwhile been a special focus of racialized interpretations of civilization, from the birth of modern Egyptology onward. Europeans of the colonial age saw Egyptian civilization as an anomaly in Africa, measured excavated skulls in an effort to prove its extraneous origins and segregated it from its geographic context. But Egyptian civilization did not develop in isolation. Rather it developed in concert with its neighbors upstream along the Nile, across adjacent deserts and seas, and over the land bridge to southwestern Asia. Its most important neighbor in northeastern Africa was the land of Kush (Nubia), where a series of cultures and states co-evolved with those of Egypt. Archaeological exploration continues to add to our knowledge of these interconnected pasts. This course will examine the history of Egypt, Kush, and adjacent regions from the late 4th millennium BCE, when the first states formed in the Nile Valley, to the late first millennium BCE, when Egypt fell under Roman rule while the kingdom of Meroe ruled the upper Nile. While the civilizations of northeastern Africa are the focus, the course will also examine their interactions with cultures of the Near East and Eastern Mediterranean. Since knowledge of ancient societies is derived from the texts and artifacts they produced, complete with their original context so far as possible, this course will emphasize primary sources, including texts (in translation), images, and archaeological remains.There are no prerequisites for the course; the only preparation necessary consists in college-level writing skills, and readiness to learn new information. Be advised that the study of ancient history requires learning a great number of foreign names and terms, as well as a lot of dates. One cannot understand relations between events and phenomena, in particular relations of cause and effect, without knowing their chronology, the participants involved, and their locations. Students must therefore learn the geography of the regions under discussion, the dates of events and periods during the three millennia the course covers, the names of populations and individual persons, and terms pertaining to the subjects of study. These kinds of information form the basis for knowledge and meaningful inquiry.",

Wherever there was trade, wherever there was movement on the seas, there was piracy. Recent scholarship on the Mediterranean has focused on connectivities, micro-environments, the uniqueness of islands, and various climatic spheres in a geographic tradition that follows the path-breaking work of Fernand Braudel. This course will consider the urban and rural dimensions of the Mediterranean region as they relate to the history of merchants and pirates. Finally, the political and military aspects of Mediterranean history will be examined. There was a continuum from piracy to privateering to war.

In South Africa, we have seen the COVID-19 pandemic and the measures implemented to control it causing massive social upheaval and personal distress. It has forced the people in the country to confront issues that life prior to the pandemic had made easy to turn away from. Misogyny, gender based violence and sexual violence – a long-standing emergency in the south of Africa – have been forced into our vision once again. It was not the pandemic that created this violence. Nor was it the first time people had been outraged by a lack of action to address it. In the years approaching 2020, calls, protests and demonstrations were increasingly demanding the culture of impunity in gender based violence be ended; sometime with violent outcomes against the protestors themselves. Over those same years, nationwide protests have rocked South Africa’s university campuses. The student movements known as #RhodesMustFall, #FeesMustFall and #RUReferenceList highlight the contrasts and disappointments of the recent past in South Africa, confront the legacy of racism and misogyny in its institutions and knowledge systems, and resonate with a history of anti-racism and struggle that now, in turn, similarly fuel the on-going Black Lives Matter and #MeToo movements worldwide.",

    "fullname": "Ancient Israel: From Conquest to Exile",
    "info": "Israel and Judah were not states of great importance in the ancient Near East.  Their population and territory were small, and they could not resist conquest by larger, more powerful states like Assyria and Rome.  Yet their ancient history matters greatly today, out of proportion to its insignificance during the periods in which it transpired.  The historical experiences of the people of Israel and Judah were accorded religious meaning and literary articulation in the Hebrew Bible (the Old Testament), which became a foundational text for Judaism, Christianity, and Islam.  Essential features of Western as well as Islamic civilization are predicated on some element of Israel’s ancient past, as mediated through the Bible; therefore it behooves us to understand that past.  But the Bible is a religious work, not a transcript of events, and the history of ancient Israel is not derived merely from reading the biblical accounts of it.  Archaeological excavations have revealed the physical remains of the cultures of Israel and neighboring lands, as well as bringing to light inscriptions, documents, and literary works produced by those cultures.  These sources, which complement and sometimes contradict the accounts conveyed in the Bible, provide the basis for reconstructing a comprehensive history of ancient Israel.This course covers the history of Israel and Judah from the Late Bronze Age (c. 1550-1200 BCE), by the end of which Israel had emerged as a distinct ethnic entity, to the period of Roman rule (63 BCE-330 CE), which saw the final extinction of ancient Israel, represented by the kingdom of Judea, as a political entity.  Knowledge of this history is based on archaeological, epigraphic, and literary sources, including the Hebrew Bible.N.B.: Students should be aware that the study of history, like all the human and natural sciences, is predicated on inquiry, not a priori judgments.  Accordingly, the Bible is not privileged as an intrinsically true or authoritative record.  No text is presumed inerrant, and all sources are subject to scrutiny, in the context of scholarly discourse.  Biblical texts are treated just like all other texts, as the products of human beings embedded in a historical context, and as the subject of analysis and interpretation.  Persons of all faiths and of no faith are equally welcome to participate in such scholarly discourse.  However, students who feel that their own religious beliefs require an understanding of the Bible that is antithetical to the foregoing statements are cautioned that they may find themselves uncomfortable with this course.",

With over three millennia as its subject, the course must of necessity be a general survey. Together we will explore the mythic structures, significant documents, historical experiences, narratives, practices, beliefs, and worldviews of the Jewish people. The course begins by examining the roots of Judaism in the Hebrew Bible and the history of ancient Israel but quickly focuses on the creative forces that developed within Judaism as a national narrative confronted the forces of history, especially in the forms of the Persian, Greek, and Roman empires.  Rabbinic Judaism becomes the most dominant creative force and will receive our greatest attention, both in its formative years and as it encounters the rise of Christianity and Islam. After studying the Jewish experience in the medieval world, we will turn to Judaism’s encounter with the enlightenment and modernity. The historical survey concludes by attending to the transformations within Judaism and Jewish life of the last 150 years, including a confrontation with the experience of the Holocaust. Woven throughout this historical survey will be repeated engagements with core questions: “Who is a Jew?” “What do Jews believe?” “What do Jews do?” “What do we mean by ‘religion’?”   “How do Jews read texts within their tradition?” And perhaps most importantly, “How many answers are there to a Jewish question?” Students in this course can expect to come away with some knowledge of the Bible in Judaism, rabbinic literature and law, Jewish mysticism and philosophy, Jewish nationalism and Zionism, Jewish culture, ritual, and worship in the synagogue, the home, and the community, and Jewish celebrations of life cycle events and the festivals.",

This has led to a sprawling, at times contradictory, but also surprisingly nimble and new kind of government. The second goal is to examine the ways the EU understands and is responding to the three major dilemmas facing it in the first decades of the 21st century: the sometimes fragile state of democracy in the member states, the migration/identity crisis, and the state of Ukraine and European security. Students will examine the institutions in play concerning each of these dilemmas, will dissect policy debates that are influencing decision-making, and will come to their own conclusions and formulate their own policies as if they were leaders of institutions.",

Moving chronologically and from the global to the local, this class will first examine the complex and intertwined reasons that prompted people to settle (either temporally or permanently) in the U.S. in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. We will explore the communalities and differences between the Poles, Ukrainians, Germans, Czechs, Slovaks, Jews, Hungarians, Slovenes, Croats, and Serbs who made up this initial wave of migration, and assess how these migrants shaped the urban and social fabric both in the United States, and in St. Paul and Minneapolis. Second, the class will examine how these communities evolved over the course in the 20th century by a) exploring topics such as ethnic identity maintenance, inter-generational relations, return migration, xenophobia and antisemitism, the relationship between migrants and the host society, and institutions (churches and synagogues, fraternal organizations, learned societies, archives, museums and libraries, etc.) established by migrants in the U.S., and b) assessing the impacts of later migration waves from Europe to the U.S., caused by the Holocaust and the Second World War, the 1956 Hungarian uprising, the 1968 Prague Spring, Soviet emigration policies, the fall of the Berlin Wall, and the civil wars in Yugoslavia. Keeping in mind the pressing ethical questions that subtend migration (both historical and contemporary), this class will also ask what it means to be a descendant of Central and Eastern European migrants in present-day Minnesota—not just of those who arrived over a century ago, but also more recent migrants, e.g., Russians, or Muslims from Bosnia-Hercegovina. To this end, we will enrich our classroom by extending it into the metro area with visits to relevant sites and meetings with representatives of some of these communities in order to understand their current lives, work, and challenges. This class will thus draw on numerous local resources: archives, buildings such as religious sites and community centers, museums, etc.",

This upper-level course, which is run as a discussion seminar, uses case studies to investigates how people of differing faiths perceived, reacted to, and changed each other, between the arrival of Jesuits and Puritans in the early 17th century and the US-Dakota War of 1862.  People who hailed from North America, Europe, and Africa had divergent ideas about the divine and its presence on Earth, about life and life after death, about religious rituals and relations of authority.  Their struggles with one another were partly struggles over religiously inflected ways of being in the world.  The course explores how religion shaped people’s responses to European colonization, the growing slave-labor system, industrialization, immigration, and westward expansion.  A religious lens onto American history reveals religion as an element of struggle and shows that freedom of conscience has been continually contested rather than easily assured.   prereq: Non-fr or instr consent",

This class requires that students complete at least 100 hours of mentoring work in History Day schools in the Twin Cities. While the focus of these hours will be in the classroom, some hours may be fulfilled through participation in other History Day support services and/or assistance with events. In addition to their commitments to their assigned school, students must participate in regular seminar meetings, complete assigned course work, and fulfill final project requirements. Following the start of the class, students will have been assigned to a school, received preliminary History Day training, meet participating teacher(s), and develop a schedule for school visits.Most of all, this course is about connections. The University is looking for civic engagement opportunities through its “Grand Challenges” curriculum that demonstrate the relevance of the institution and the contributions of its students to the citizens of the state. The College of Liberal Arts “roadmap” also places specific emphasis on connecting its majors to the structures of education in Minnesota. Furthermore, the connections you make in applied learning situations (internships and/or service learning) can be a determining factor in shaping future career paths or graduate education. The History Day mentor program is a unique opportunity to apply your academic skills in a real-world educational environment. Your efforts will assist teachers on the frontlines of education, and you will help build pathways to higher education for inner-city students. The instructors appreciate the interest in service learning that has brought you to this course, and it is our hope that this opportunity proves to be a highlight of your undergraduate experience.",

    "info": "The proliferation of public use datasets, computer-based information technologies, and the growing utilization of quantitative methods in social research—including research in history, demography, public health, and economics—have made it increasingly necessary for students to become familiar with quantitative methods. This course has several specific and complementary goals. The first is to familiarize students—particularly graduate students in history and the population training program in the Minnesota Population Center—with the use of descriptive and inferential statistics in social research. Associated with this objective is a stress on basic numeracy and learning to read and evaluate newspaper articles, journal articles and monographs that employ a variety of statistical techniques and measures. We will devote about one hour a week to discussion of quantitative articles, focusing on the demographic history of the United States from the eighteenth century to the present. The readings for most of the semester are not set in stone; however, we will tailor them to the substantive interests of the class. This is also a “hands on” course, where you will be trained in the practice of quantitative methods. Our primary data source will be IPUMS census datasets for U.S. census years between 1850-2020, although we will also examine our public use data sources including IPUMS international and datasets available at ICPSR at the University of Michigan. Members of the class are expected to plan and carry out quantitative research projects of their own. A series of short exercises will prepare you for a research project utilizing skills learned over the course of the semester. The final quantitative research project, presented in the form of a poster, is an important component of the course. A final goal of History 5011 is to acquaint students with computers and computer applications useful in quantitative analysis, notably STATA (a syllabic abbreviation of the words statistics and data and a leading provider of statistical software for the social sciences).",

The readings for the workshop are submissions from the membership of the workshop (which will include participants who are not formally enrolled in the workshop). We read and consider two submissions per week (sometimes more if the submissions are shorter) that are pre-circulated to all participants via the workshop’s listserv. Readings under consideration include research papers, dissertation chapters, article manuscripts, research proposals, conference papers, and other submissions that will benefit from intensive engagement with the members and will deepen the knowledge of all of the participants. Students will gain experience with the research, writing, and revision process as well as scholarly conversations about original research and writing. The overarching aim of the workshop is to develop research, writing, revision, and scholarly discussion skills as well as community-building in American Indian and Indigenous Studies and professionalization in an increasingly interdisciplinary and global field of study",

It is structured around five core methodologies--excavation, documentation, reconstruction, interpretation, and exhibition. In each unit, students will be first be tasked with identifying the underlying principles of these methodological approaches. They will then use class time to explore technologies that extend those methods such as high-resolution imaging, relational databases, text mining programs, virtual environments, and content management systems for website building.

Readings will include primary legal sources, such as treatises, statutes, constitutions, and landmark cases, as well as contemporary religious, scientific, and literary works, which will help to situate the legal materials in broader cultural context. Several secondary sources will also be considered, both for insights into the topics covered, and to illustrate various approaches to legal-historical analysis.
