The course has four specific purposes: (1) Increase student understanding of their research projects; (2) Encourage planning and research discussions between APS graduate students with their advisors and committee members; (3) Provide experience and guidance to students with the proposal writing, editing, and peer-review process; and (4) Facilitate the preparation of student thesis proposals, in accordance with the APS program requirements. The final product of this effort will be a drafted thesis proposal that each student will submit to their committee members and the program. Submission of a complete proposal to the student's committee and the APS program is required to complete this course.prereq: APS Graduate Student",
